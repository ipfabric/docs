telnet on the terminal line or are accessible through TELNET protocol,
which can be undesired due to various policies or compliance protocols.
“Configuration register” reports devices with an unusual configuration
register or boot setting, which may cause issues at the next device
reboot. “Unexpected reloads” reports unexpected reasons for device
reload, such as software or hardware-caused crashes. “OS version
