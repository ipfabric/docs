# Vulnerability reports

A vulnerability is a system weakness that can be exploited by a
potential attacker. Because your safety is our priority we are doing
everything we can to prevent any vulnerabilities.

To prevent any of those threats, we are also looking for your findings.
Because your findings can make IP Fabric even better and safer.

If you encounter any vulnerabilities, please report them to us on email
<security@ipfabric.io> or open a ticket with the critical priority on
our support portal <http://support.ipfabric.io/>

We will investigate them as soon as possible, evaluate the situation and
if they are critical we will fix them as soon as possible in a hotfix
release.
