# Administrative Interface

## Administrative Interface

For [system
status](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ND/pages/1899823108/System+Status),
[backup and restore](Backup_and_restore), [upgrade](System_Update), and
[administratorÂ tasks](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ND/pages/1830944773/System+Administration),
IP Fabric has a dedicated web-based administrative interface which is
fully separate from the primary system functions. The administrative
interface is available through port 8443. e.g.
<https://ipfabric.company.com:8443> and uses **osadmin** credentials
defined during the [First Boot
Wizard](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ND/pages/901808145/Deploying+VMware+OVA+Virtual+Machine).
