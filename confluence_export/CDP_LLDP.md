## CDP/LLDP

The Discovery Protocols section provides information about link layer
discovery protocols such as CDP and LLDP. “All neighbors” lists
information about all neighborships. “Unmanaged neighbors” provides
information for when a remote neighbor is not accessible.
“Unidirectional neighbors” provides information when only one side can
see the neighborship, creating a unidirectional state.
