The lightweight discovery capabilities (through SSH or telnet) quickly detect the current network state, including detailed data for each address and port. A network model of gathered data reconstructs the topologies for each switching and routing protocol to enable a cross-technology analysis of upstream and downstream relationships. Dependencies and dependents are calculated for each network element, allowing analysis to represent each aspect of the network in the context of productivity impact on the downstream hosts and on network devices, while the immediate productivity impact of performance and capacity is calculated for each user and every element. Architecture A distributed system of micro-service components resides within IP Fabric VM, all based around a multi-model database with a mathematical network model at its core. Operating system-level controls provide high availability, security and log collection. The kernel-level bidirectional traffic shaper and application-level worker flow control mechanisms provide comprehensive traffic management and automatically respond to any sign of network congestion to ensure that only freely available bandwidth is utilized. The user interface is available on port 443 of the VM's IP address through any modern web browser and on any screen. Table output can be exported into CSV format for further processing, and selected reports are exportable into Word format. Operational Requirements Hardware Requirements The IP Fabric platform runs on Intel Xeon Nehalem CPUs or later. The system runs in at least 4 parallel threads, but scheduling can handle operations even down to a single thread. IP Fabric uses less than 4GB of RAM when idle, and an additional 12GB of RAM is required for collected network information. The base installation requires 80GB of HDD space and an additional 50MB per device for the network. Minimum requirements are: CPU RAM HDD 4C 16 GB 90GB The following table represents the recommended hardware requirements for optimal performance of the platform based on the number of network infrastructure devices in the network. Devices CPU RAM HDD (OS + data) 500 4 16 GB 90 GB (80G + 10G) 1 000 4 32 GB 100 GB (80G + 20G) 2 000 8 64 GB 200 GB (80G + 120G) 5 000 12 64 GB 300 GB (80G + 220G) 10 000 16 128 GB 550 GB (80G + 470G) 20 000 18 256 GB 1000 GB (80G + 920G) Additional resources requirements To make sure you have enough resources, please use the following formulas. Data disk storage requires 1MB per device per each snapshot (example: 1350 devices, plan is to keep up to 100 snapshots => 135 GB data storage). Memory requires 5MB of RAM per device per each loaded snapshot (example: 1200 devices, up to 100 snapshots but only 3 loaded at a time (1200 x 5 = 6000 x 3) => 18 GB RAM). Note The recommended hardware resources may not allow running the most demanding graph traversal functions. These functions may require a sizable memory pool to complete successfully. Network Connectivity Requirements During the snapshot operations, the user can control network bandwidth limit which never exceeds an aggregate of set bandwidths in any direction to provide an additional safety measure. IP Fabric should be connected to a network that has direct connectivity to managed devices. Jumphost server can also be set-up and used. (Jumphost server requires an installation of SSH Python (versions 2.4 to 3.7).)

Network Access Credentials Requirements Network device access IP Fabric accesses network-infrastructure devices via CLI (command-line interface) using SSH or TELNET protocols. All device interaction is accounted on the platform and only \"read-only\" or \"operator\" group privilege level 1 credentials are required. The following list contains an example of commands used for Cisco IOS: terminal length 0 show version show inventory show etherchannel summary show interfaces [status|switchport] show ip int [brief] show ip vrf show ip arp show ip route show ip cef show ip access-list show cdp neighbors detail show lldp neighbors detail show mac address-table show spanning-tree [detail|mst|summary] show standby [brief] show vrrp [brief] show vlan brief In the beginning, IP Fabric fingerprints the device using the \"show version\" command (or equivalent) to identify a vendor and a system version. A \"terminal length\" command is optional but highly recommended, as it greatly improves the speed of the device interaction, reduces the load on the network and the device, and improves collection precision. Additional device access Since firewalls do not follow privilege levels, it may be necessary to explicitly specify the commands allowed for each user. The following list specifies the exec-mode commands needed for firewall discovery. show version show interface show route show arp show context terminal pager 0 Turning off paging greatly improves the speed of the discovery and allows a terminal pager command, making it highly recommended although not mandatory. The commands can be allowed through the central TACACS or RADIUS access control system, or they can be configured locally on a device. The following example adds the necessary commands to a privilege-1 user: privilege show level 1 mode exec command interface privilege show level 1 mode exec command arp privilege show level 1 mode exec command route privilege show level 1 mode exec command context privilege cmd level 1 mode exec command terminal List of all commands used for CLI discovery can be found on this page and in this feature/vendor matrix .","title":"IP Fabric Overview"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/#ip-fabric-overview","text":"The IP Fabric network infrastructure management platform provides on-demand network discovery, advanced analytics, and detailed engineering visibility.

The process is controlled from the discovery tab of the web user interface using the (start) and (stop) buttons. The timing of the network discovery snapshots can be automated in Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Snapshots to collect data in periodic intervals or at a specific time. It is recommended to do a network discovery at least once a day to record all network changes. Connectivity Report A connection to every attempted address either succeeds or is recorded in the Connectivity Report which details the reason for the connection failure. The most frequent reason for failure is a timeout of the login attempt. A connectivity report can be useful for troubleshooting failed credentials and other unreachability reasons. An authentication failure messages denote an unsuccessful login attempt and provide a description of how the device has responded. Bandwidth Limit Bandwidth limit controls the amount of traffic sent to and received from the network infrastructure using bidirectional shaper and application flow control mechanisms. The traffic rate never exceeds the configured limit in either direction, allowing discovery and analysis processes to be run during business hours, thereby not overloading the network infrastructure devices any more than during standard operational procedures. To further distribute the network load and reduce the possibility of the bottlenecks, the connection scheduler sorts connections attempts to addresses that are farthest away. For example, in a list of addresses 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.20.10.1, 10.10.20.1 , after attempting a connection to 10.10.10.1 , the next IP scheduled is 10.20.10.1 , because it shares only 11 bits with 10.10.10.1 . This lowest common mask rule enables statistically distributing the load without prior topology knowledge. The selected number of megabits per second also controls the number of simultaneous connections. Each additional megabit adds 3 parallel sessions. Discovery Process Discovery is performed via a lightweight interaction with the network infrastructure using CLI management protocols and ICMP probes. If the initial seed is not entered, the discovery mechanism attempts to login to the default gateway and to responders of ICMP probes returning from the traceroute to the 10.0.0.0 network address. After a successful login, discovery reads the network protocol state tables and looks for known neighbours, such as routing protocol next hops, ARP entries with MAC addresses of supported vendors, and CDP and LLDP neighbour information. A connection attempt is made to each potential network infrastructure device. Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks on the routing table. This is how the discovery process continues after a successful connection to a network device: IP Fabric looks at LLDP/CDP and other neighbor protocols of the discovered device and tries to connect to those devices IP Fabric tries to connect to a next-hop device from the routing table IP Fabric use the device's ARP table to find hosts and other network devices it can connect to with the help of OUI table in IP Fabric ( Settings \u2192 OUI ) Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks in the routing table. Discovery then collects the detailed network state and information from every discovered device for every supported running protocol. All collected data is timestamped at the reading time and the timestamps are used to calculate the rate of change for each element. Discovery also computes network topology and cross-technology dependencies by using network graph traversals of upstream and downstream paths. A topology for each protocol is computed separately. A managed network is considered to consist of every discovered device under a coherent administrative domain, as restricted by access credentials, and the full list of devices is available in the inventory. The spanning-tree domain is a topology of contiguously connected spanning-tree instances and signifies a Layer 2 failure domain in the case of a cascading Layer 2 failure. The routing domain is a topology of contiguously connected forwarding hops and signifies a Layer 3 failure domain in the case of a cascading Layer 3 failure.","title":"How Discovery Works"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/discovery/#how-discovery-works","text":"","title":"How Discovery Works"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/discovery/#overview","text":"Discovery creates a snapshot of the network, finding all active network infrastructure devices and collecting the current state of network protocols and technologies.

A network snapshot is a fully functional software copy of the network, including all configuration and state data. Active network view displays information from a network snapshot which can be selected using Snapshot selector drop-down menu in the top left corner of the Main User Interface. Snapshot Management Up to five (5) snapshots can be loaded simultaneously into active memory. When the snapshot is active it is considered \"loaded\". Other snapshots can be stored on HDD, with only free HDD space being the limiting factor. Locking active snapshot will always keep snapshot in memory. Unloading snapshot will move network state information from RAM to HDD. It usually takes several minutes to load and unload the snapshot, depending on the network size. Snapshots can be downloaded for external storage, which can be later uploaded back to the system. Snapshots can be cloned to accommodate change management practices, for example when change comparison is desired but only a small part of the network is affected by the change. A snapshot can be restricted to a specific portion of the network through IP Scope in Advanced Settings menu. This will enable visual comparison of a portion of the network, and provide historical data for the collected portion of the network. However when comparing partial snapshot with full network snapshot, a number of false positives will appear, because large portion of the network will be missing. Snapshots can be also permanently deleted from the system. Snapshot Manipulation New network state snapshots can be created from the Discovery page using the start button.

This command also starts up just created VM. Additionally, you can create and add a new empty virtual disk if needed . Deploying to Amazon AWS EC2 instance Pre-requisites Before you begin the deployment, please note the following: IP Fabric uses SSH, telnet and REST API over http/https in order to access network devices and controllers and carry out its discovery. Please ensure that the VPC subnet chosen for the deployment has the appropriate level of access and routing in order to complete the discovery. The IP Fabric AMI uses SSH for CLI console access, and HTTPS on ports 443 and 8443 for Web UI and system console access respectively. Security groups will need the appropriate configuration to allow inbound access to the AMI. Deployment Steps Login to the AWS console for the account provided to the IP Fabric support team. Select the region for the VPC where you want to deploy IP Fabric: From the Services menu at the top left, select EC2 . Then choose Instances in the left hand menu, and hit the Launch Instances button on the right: Select My AMIs , then under Ownership , select Shared with me . The IP Fabric AMI should show up here. Select it. Choose the most appropriate instance type: Devices CPU RAM HDD Example EC2 Instance Type 500 4 16 GB 90 GB c5.2xlarge 1 000 4 32 GB 100 GB c5.4xlarge 2 000 8 32 GB 200 GB c5.4xlarge 5 000 12 64 GB 300 GB c5.9xlarge 10 000 16 128 GB 550 GB c5.18xlarge 20 000 18 256 GB 1000 GB d3.8xlarge Selecting an appropriate instance type is necessary to achieve a stable and reliable system! Please double-check if your Instance settings are proper for your environment size. Select Configure Instance Details , then ensure the correct VPC and subnet are selected for the IP Fabric instance. (Create a new VPC and subnet if required): Then select Add Storage , add 80G to the additional amount from the table above for the root volume. For example, the instance c5.4xlarge should have 200G in total. Select Edit Security Groups to make sure that IP Fabric will have the connectivity it requires to function: Confirm the details with the IP Fabric Connectivity Requirements . The security group rules should look something like: Note Note that you can only select incoming rules at this point! By default the security group allows access to everything over any protocol and port: you will need to revisit once the instance has launched if you need to restrict access at source. Click Review and Launch . At this point, if you never used Debian in AWS before, subscription alert can appear. If requires, please follow instruction and open hyperlink in Error message: In order to user this AWS Marketplace product\u2026. On new page, please click Continue to Subscribe When done, please click Launch button once again. Please confirm Key pair information and click Launch Instance . Your Instance appears in the instances list, and it is started automatically by AWS: You can now access the Web UI, install the license file and login to the instance to run the Configuration Wizard. There is a bug in the latest version and you will need to setup traceroute in the IPFabric in order to run Discovery. traceroute must be setup to -- 127.0.0.1/32 . This is going to be fixed in the future. Complete (first-time) Boot Wizard The First Boot Wizard starts when IP Fabric is run for the first time and configures system options. The wizard can also be re-run later from the service interface to modify basic system parameters. Assign hostname. Assign domain name. Choose IP address acquisition method. If a static method is used, configure IP address, netmask, default GW, and DNS servers. Configure NTP servers or just click OK to continue if not using NTP. Select time zone. Configure Internet Proxy if used. Set shell user password of osadmin user. The password is used to access the IP Fabric administrative interface and system shell (not for the GUI access, the GUI is accessible with the admin username by default, for more information, please, read: Access User Interface and Install License and also for encrypting system backups. Optionally define organization parameters for the local SSL certificate. After rebooting, the console login screen will display the assigned IP address of the system and provide a link to access the user interface. Warning Remember password from step 8! IP Fabric support engineers are able to reset osadmin user passwords but encrypted backups will be lost !

For example, for testing authentication credentials from the specific IP address of IP Fabric VM, in case of address-restricted access. The CLI interface is the main tool in servicing the system by the support teams. A first boot wizard can be used to change system settings, such as IP addressing parameters, domain names, NTP, system proxy settings, or a user's password. To launch First Boot Wizard again, connect via SSH to IP Fabric as osadmin user, launch ipfabric-net-wizard and then reboot the system. Command-line also allows the use of the standard networking tools, such as telnet , ssh , traceroute or ping . In the event of a VM network connection problem, DNS issues, network devices connectivity issue, IP Fabric CLI is a useful helper. CLI can be also used to access system and application logs as well as snapshot files. System and application logs System and application logs are placed in /var/log folder. Specifically IP Fabric application logs can be found in /var/log/nimpee . Snapshots Snapshots are available in osadmin home directory /home/osadmin/snapshots .
