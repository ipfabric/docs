The lightweight discovery capabilities (through SSH or telnet) quickly detect the current network state, including detailed data for each address and port. A network model of gathered data reconstructs the topologies for each switching and routing protocol to enable a cross-technology analysis of upstream and downstream relationships. Dependencies and dependents are calculated for each network element, allowing analysis to represent each aspect of the network in the context of productivity impact on the downstream hosts and on network devices, while the immediate productivity impact of performance and capacity is calculated for each user and every element. Architecture A distributed system of micro-service components resides within IP Fabric VM, all based around a multi-model database with a mathematical network model at its core. Operating system-level controls provide high availability, security and log collection. The kernel-level bidirectional traffic shaper and application-level worker flow control mechanisms provide comprehensive traffic management and automatically respond to any sign of network congestion to ensure that only freely available bandwidth is utilized. The user interface is available on port 443 of the VM's IP address through any modern web browser and on any screen. Table output can be exported into CSV format for further processing, and selected reports are exportable into Word format. Operational Requirements Hardware Requirements The IP Fabric platform runs on Intel Xeon Nehalem CPUs or later. The system runs in at least 4 parallel threads, but scheduling can handle operations even down to a single thread. IP Fabric uses less than 4GB of RAM when idle, and an additional 12GB of RAM is required for collected network information. The base installation requires 80GB of HDD space and an additional 50MB per device for the network. Minimum requirements are: CPU RAM HDD 4C 16 GB 90GB The following table represents the recommended hardware requirements for optimal performance of the platform based on the number of network infrastructure devices in the network. Devices CPU RAM HDD (OS + data) 500 4 16 GB 90 GB (80G + 10G) 1 000 4 32 GB 100 GB (80G + 20G) 2 000 8 64 GB 200 GB (80G + 120G) 5 000 12 64 GB 300 GB (80G + 220G) 10 000 16 128 GB 550 GB (80G + 470G) 20 000 18 256 GB 1000 GB (80G + 920G) Additional resources requirements To make sure you have enough resources, please use the following formulas. Data disk storage requires 1MB per device per each snapshot (example: 1350 devices, plan is to keep up to 100 snapshots => 135 GB data storage). Memory requires 5MB of RAM per device per each loaded snapshot (example: 1200 devices, up to 100 snapshots but only 3 loaded at a time (1200 x 5 = 6000 x 3) => 18 GB RAM). Note The recommended hardware resources may not allow running the most demanding graph traversal functions. These functions may require a sizable memory pool to complete successfully. Network Connectivity Requirements During the snapshot operations, the user can control network bandwidth limit which never exceeds an aggregate of set bandwidths in any direction to provide an additional safety measure. IP Fabric should be connected to a network that has direct connectivity to managed devices. Jumphost server can also be set-up and used. (Jumphost server requires an installation of SSH Python (versions 2.4 to 3.7).)

Network Access Credentials Requirements Network device access IP Fabric accesses network-infrastructure devices via CLI (command-line interface) using SSH or TELNET protocols. All device interaction is accounted on the platform and only \"read-only\" or \"operator\" group privilege level 1 credentials are required. The following list contains an example of commands used for Cisco IOS: terminal length 0 show version show inventory show etherchannel summary show interfaces [status|switchport] show ip int [brief] show ip vrf show ip arp show ip route show ip cef show ip access-list show cdp neighbors detail show lldp neighbors detail show mac address-table show spanning-tree [detail|mst|summary] show standby [brief] show vrrp [brief] show vlan brief In the beginning, IP Fabric fingerprints the device using the \"show version\" command (or equivalent) to identify a vendor and a system version. A \"terminal length\" command is optional but highly recommended, as it greatly improves the speed of the device interaction, reduces the load on the network and the device, and improves collection precision. Additional device access Since firewalls do not follow privilege levels, it may be necessary to explicitly specify the commands allowed for each user. The following list specifies the exec-mode commands needed for firewall discovery. show version show interface show route show arp show context terminal pager 0 Turning off paging greatly improves the speed of the discovery and allows a terminal pager command, making it highly recommended although not mandatory. The commands can be allowed through the central TACACS or RADIUS access control system, or they can be configured locally on a device. The following example adds the necessary commands to a privilege-1 user: privilege show level 1 mode exec command interface privilege show level 1 mode exec command arp privilege show level 1 mode exec command route privilege show level 1 mode exec command context privilege cmd level 1 mode exec command terminal List of all commands used for CLI discovery can be found on this page and in this feature/vendor matrix . Staging vs Production Deployment IP Fabric is a complex solution with multiple moving parts. We thoroughly test every release before it is made available to our customers. Testing comprises of the automated unit testing on the code level and automated tests run against various physical and virtual lab environments. These emulate complex networks with many devices from multiple vendors. Despite these efforts, issues can still arise after deploying a new version of IP Fabric to the customer's environment. For example, it is not feasible to replicate the entire network or a combination of particular device models. Therefore, we suggest 2-stage deployment of the new IP Fabric releases for complex or critical implementations. The first stage is staging deployment, used to verify the functionality of the new release within the customer's environment. Info You will need a valid license for the staging deployment. Please, contact our sales team to check eligibility for a free complimentary license. The second stage is the deployment to the production / live environment. The staging environment's sizing follows the suggestions mentioned above for a standard deployment. We don't provide special staging builds. These are regular production builds, which are just deployed separately not to potentially disrupt the day-to-day use of IP Fabric within the organization. We suggest that you make stating as close as possible to the final production environment. The staging environment should discover the same devices as the production (e.g., there is only a limited value if the staging environment \"sees\" only 500 network devices, while the whole network consists of thousands of devices). On the other side, it is perfectly fine to provision the staging environment dynamically if your deployment environment allows it. Also, a typical \"acceptance test\" on the staging environment lasts only a couple of days to verify overall functionality.","title":"IP Fabric Overview"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/#ip-fabric-overview","text":"The IP Fabric network infrastructure management platform provides on-demand network discovery, advanced analytics, and detailed engineering visibility.

The process is controlled from the discovery tab of the web user interface using the (start) and (stop) buttons. The timing of the network discovery snapshots can be automated in Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Snapshots to collect data in periodic intervals or at a specific time. It is recommended to do a network discovery at least once a day to record all network changes. Connectivity Report A connection to every attempted address either succeeds or is recorded in the Connectivity Report which details the reason for the connection failure. The most frequent reason for failure is a timeout of the login attempt. A connectivity report can be useful for troubleshooting failed credentials and other unreachability reasons. An authentication failure messages denote an unsuccessful login attempt and provide a description of how the device has responded. Bandwidth Limit Bandwidth limit controls the amount of traffic sent to and received from the network infrastructure using bidirectional shaper and application flow control mechanisms. The traffic rate never exceeds the configured limit in either direction, allowing discovery and analysis processes to be run during business hours, thereby not overloading the network infrastructure devices any more than during standard operational procedures. To further distribute the network load and reduce the possibility of the bottlenecks, the connection scheduler sorts connections attempts to addresses that are farthest away. For example, in a list of addresses 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.20.10.1, 10.10.20.1 , after attempting a connection to 10.10.10.1 , the next IP scheduled is 10.20.10.1 , because it shares only 11 bits with 10.10.10.1 . This lowest common mask rule enables statistically distributing the load without prior topology knowledge. The selected number of megabits per second also controls the number of simultaneous connections. Each additional megabit adds 3 parallel sessions. Discovery Process Discovery is performed via a lightweight interaction with the network infrastructure using CLI management protocols and ICMP probes. If the initial seed is not entered, the discovery mechanism attempts to login to the default gateway and to responders of ICMP probes returning from the traceroute to the 10.0.0.0 network address. After a successful login, discovery reads the network protocol state tables and looks for known neighbours, such as routing protocol next hops, ARP entries with MAC addresses of supported vendors, and CDP and LLDP neighbour information. A connection attempt is made to each potential network infrastructure device. Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks on the routing table. This is how the discovery process continues after a successful connection to a network device: IP Fabric looks at LLDP/CDP and other neighbor protocols of the discovered device and tries to connect to those devices IP Fabric tries to connect to a next-hop device from the routing table IP Fabric use the device's ARP table to find hosts and other network devices it can connect to with the help of OUI table in IP Fabric ( Settings \u2192 OUI ) Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks in the routing table. Discovery then collects the detailed network state and information from every discovered device for every supported running protocol. All collected data is timestamped at the reading time and the timestamps are used to calculate the rate of change for each element. Discovery also computes network topology and cross-technology dependencies by using network graph traversals of upstream and downstream paths. A topology for each protocol is computed separately. A managed network is considered to consist of every discovered device under a coherent administrative domain, as restricted by access credentials, and the full list of devices is available in the inventory. The spanning-tree domain is a topology of contiguously connected spanning-tree instances and signifies a Layer 2 failure domain in the case of a cascading Layer 2 failure. The routing domain is a topology of contiguously connected forwarding hops and signifies a Layer 3 failure domain in the case of a cascading Layer 3 failure.","title":"How Discovery Works"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/discovery/#how-discovery-works","text":"","title":"How Discovery Works"},{"location":"Getting_Started/overview/discovery/#overview","text":"Discovery creates a snapshot of the network, finding all active network infrastructure devices and collecting the current state of network protocols and technologies.

This command also starts up just created VM. Additionally, you can create and add a new empty virtual disk if needed . Deploying to Amazon AWS EC2 instance Pre-requisites Before you begin the deployment, please note the following: IP Fabric uses SSH, telnet and REST API over http/https in order to access network devices and controllers and carry out its discovery. Please ensure that the VPC subnet chosen for the deployment has the appropriate level of access and routing in order to complete the discovery. The IP Fabric AMI uses SSH for CLI console access, and HTTPS on ports 443 and 8443 for Web UI and system console access respectively. Security groups will need the appropriate configuration to allow inbound access to the AMI. Deployment Steps Login to the AWS console for the account provided to the IP Fabric support team. Select the region for the VPC where you want to deploy IP Fabric: From the Services menu at the top left, select EC2 . Then choose Instances in the left hand menu, and hit the Launch Instances button on the right: Select My AMIs , then under Ownership , select Shared with me . The IP Fabric AMI should show up here. Select it. Choose the most appropriate instance type: Devices CPU RAM HDD Example EC2 Instance Type 500 4 16 GB 90 GB c5.2xlarge 1 000 4 32 GB 100 GB c5.4xlarge 2 000 8 32 GB 200 GB c5.4xlarge 5 000 12 64 GB 300 GB c5.9xlarge 10 000 16 128 GB 550 GB c5.18xlarge 20 000 18 256 GB 1000 GB d3.8xlarge Selecting an appropriate instance type is necessary to achieve a stable and reliable system! Please double-check if your Instance settings are proper for your environment size. Select Configure Instance Details , then ensure the correct VPC and subnet are selected for the IP Fabric instance. (Create a new VPC and subnet if required): Then select Add Storage , add 80G to the additional amount from the table above for the root volume. For example, the instance c5.4xlarge should have 200G in total. Select Edit Security Groups to make sure that IP Fabric will have the connectivity it requires to function: Confirm the details with the IP Fabric Connectivity Requirements . The security group rules should look something like: Note Note that you can only select incoming rules at this point! By default the security group allows access to everything over any protocol and port: you will need to revisit once the instance has launched if you need to restrict access at source. Click Review and Launch . At this point, if you never used Debian in AWS before, subscription alert can appear. If requires, please follow instruction and open hyperlink in Error message: In order to user this AWS Marketplace product\u2026. On new page, please click Continue to Subscribe When done, please click Launch button once again. Please confirm Key pair information and click Launch Instance . Your Instance appears in the instances list, and it is started automatically by AWS: You can now access the Web UI, install the license file and login to the instance to run the Configuration Wizard. There is a bug in the latest version and you will need to setup traceroute in the IPFabric in order to run Discovery. traceroute must be setup to -- 127.0.0.1/32 . This is going to be fixed in the future. Complete (first-time) Boot Wizard The First Boot Wizard starts when IP Fabric is run for the first time and configures system options. The wizard can also be re-run later from the service interface to modify basic system parameters. Assign hostname. Assign domain name. Choose IP address acquisition method. If a static method is used, configure IP address, netmask, default GW, and DNS servers. Configure NTP servers or just click OK to continue if not using NTP. Select time zone. Configure Internet Proxy if used. Set shell user password of osadmin user. The password is used to access the IP Fabric administrative interface and system shell (not for the GUI access, the GUI is accessible with the admin username by default, for more information, please, read: Access User Interface and Install License and also for encrypting system backups. Optionally define organization parameters for the local SSL certificate. After rebooting, the console login screen will display the assigned IP address of the system and provide a link to access the user interface. Warning Remember password from step 8! IP Fabric support engineers are able to reset osadmin user passwords but encrypted backups will be lost !

A site can be a branch, a factory, a production floor, a campus, or anything that might represent a logical group for a user. By default, the Site distribution is generated automatically after the discovery process ends and is based on the rules described below. It can also be triggered manually without the need for the whole discovery process by going to Settings \u2192 Site separation (In global or Snapshot settings) (in global or Snapshot settings). Routing and switching domain Note With this setting, you can manually edit the distribution of sites later. Sites can be also renamed. By default, the site is comprised of the topology of all contiguously interconnected protocols, and the boundary of a site is formed by the network protocol relation that is not under management using the provided authentication credentials. The default separation is useful for MPLS networks where directly connected routing infrastructure at the site\u2019s edge is not accessible. For situations where an inaccessible routed firewall is used at the site (i.e. device under different management team), an option Firewall at site can be turned on so the infrastructure before and behind the firewall is not separated into two different sites. For networks that have direct routing connectivity between sites, such as DMVPN or Leased Lines (usually over Serial or MFR interfaces), an option to separate the site using tunnel and/or serial the interface should be selected. For configuration go to Settings \u2192 Site separation Version 4.3 example IP Fabric Versions <= 4.2.1 RegEx based on hostname Note Site distribution cannot be changed manually when regex rules are used. Sites cannot be renamed. Alternatively, site separation can follow a specific Regular Expression (RegEx) where separation will be performed based on portion of a device hostname. Go to Settings \u2192 Site separation and change Routing & Switching Domain to RegEx based on hostname or create a new rule by Add rule button. Transform hostname is used to normalize site names based on hostname: Upper case (default) - first hostname \"PRAGUE-RTR1\", second hostname \"prague-rtr2\" => result is that both devices in one site named \"PRAGUE\" Lower case - first hostname \"PRAGUE-RTR1\", second hostname \"prague-rtr2\" => result is that both devices in one site named \"prague\" No transformation - first hostname \"PRAGUE-RTR1\", second hostname \"prague-rtr2\" =>result is that each device has its own site named \"PRAGUE\" and \"prague\" In the last step, introduce the Regular Expression . Use this tool for validation and parentheses to extract the site from the hostname correctly. Hint If you cannot cover the names of the sites with one regex, you can use logical or . Use | (pipe) between RegEx rules. The change in the regex is displayed as a live preview. Once the regex is ready, click Site overview with this RegEx and observe results. Click Save (in the upper right corner). Example We have several locations whose name is logically designed as one letter with one to three numbers. From the point of view of a regex, such a site can generally be expressed as ^(\\[a-zA-Z\\]\\\\d{1,3}) . Unfortunately, we have two other sites that do not fit into this schema. These sites can be defined with their own regex and this can be added to the original one using the logical operator or : ^([a-zA-Z\\]\\d{1,3}|HWLAB|static\\d{1}) to combine these 3 separate options together. For devices that do not match the RegEx, IP Fabric automatically adds those to the site based on protocol relation (CDP, LLDP, STP, L3) under the condition that there's only a single relation to one particular site. This feature is especially useful for Access Points and similar devices, that do not follow the standard naming conventions and are linked to one specific location. Manual Site Separation Note With this setting, you can manually edit the distribution of sites. The Manual Site Separation option is complementary to two previous options and provides the users with full flexibility. Go to Settings \u2192 Site separation and select Manual site separation from drop down menu and save changes.

Testing The UI now allows you to edit and test your rules directly in the browser when selecting the Test rule option. Here you can see a live preview of devices that will match the regex you created. You can also test SNMP location rules: RegEx example: We have several locations whose name is logically designed as one letter with one to three numbers. From the point of view of a regex, such a site can generally be expressed as \" ^([a-zA-Z]\\d{1,3}) \". Unfortunately, we have two other sites that do not fit into this schema. These sites can be defined with their own regex and this can be added to the original one using the logical operator or : ^([a-zA-Z]\\d{1,3}|HWLAB|static\\d{1}) - 1st option OR 2nd option OR 3rd option Device Neighborship This option will try to define a device based on its neighbor relationship if a device does not match any previous rule. Perhaps you have devices in your environment that do not follow the normal standard like in a DMZ zone or Day 0 devices that have not been fully configured. If that device is connected to a device that did match a rule, IP Fabric will intelligently group it to the correct site. Manual Site Separation (Device Attributes) The Manual Site Separation enables the Device Attributes feature to create manual separation if a device does not follow a standard hostname rule or perhaps the hostname is duplicated in multiple locations. To configure Device Attributes first enable the toggle in the Site Separation Menu and select Configure or the Device Attributes menu under settings. Device Attributes - Serial Number is IP Fabric\u2019s \u201cUnique Serial Number\u201d (API column \u201csn\u201d); this is not the column \u201cSerial Number\u201d which represents the Hardware SN (API column \u201csnHw\u201d) - Devices discovered via API can also be assigned using Device Attributes. - Hostname is populated by IP Fabric when a device matching the Serial Number is found - Attribute is the Device Attribute to assign, since we want to set the Site based on the serial number set it to Site name - Value is the attribute\u2019s value to assign, in this case we want to split site L35 into separate sites named 35COLO, 35PRODUCTION, 35HEADOFFICE Creating rules in the UI You are able to create rules in the UI by selecting the Add attribute button.

For connecting, IP Fabric uses the sshuttle library that has the following requirements for the jump host. . Warning Please bear in mind, that once the connection is established, it will be enabled permanently, until disabled or removed! If there are any network issues, IP Fabric software will try to establish a connection periodically. Warning At least one seed IP address has to be provided as a starting point behind Jumphost in seed configuration.

Otherwise, your IP connection will be lost and you will have to recover from the console. SSH key configuration Note Adding ssh key to proxy server allows you to avoid using passwords for authentication. Download ssh key from Jumphost settings Save ipf-discovery-public-key.pub Copy file content to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (or equivalent) file of the user that will authenticate with Jumphost server. If the key has been copied you can use the option Use SSH keys while adding a new Jumphost server, instead of Use credentials .

We can compare that with the Web UI dialogue for the same check: So once we have found the report we are looking for, we retrieve the technology table from the \u201capiEndpoint\u201d field in the report dictionary, filtered for the colour that matches the condition we\u2019re interested in from the validation check. From our above example then, to retrieve the DMVPN tunnels that are in an \u201cUP\u201d state, we make a POST request to /api/v1/tables/security/dmvpn with the following request payload: { \"columns\" : [ \"id\" , \"sn\" , \"hostname\" , \"siteKey\" , \"siteName\" , \"peerNbma\" , \"peerTunnel\" , \"state\" , \"time\" , \"attrb\" ], \"filters\" : { \"state\" : [ \"color\" , \"eq\" , \"0\" ]}, \"snapshot\" : \"$last\" , \"reports\" : \"/technology/security/dmvpn\" } This will retrieve a dictionary with the data from the columns listed in the technology table from the last snapshot, filtered on the value of the \u201cstate\u201d column equalling 0 - which equates to the colour green from the validation check.

We can compare that with the Web UI dialogue for the same check: So once we have found the report we are looking for, we retrieve the technology table from the \u201capiEndpoint\u201d field in the report dictionary, filtered for the colour that matches the condition we\u2019re interested in from the validation check. From our above example then, to retrieve the DMVPN tunnels that are in an \u201cUP\u201d state, we make a POST request to /api/v1/tables/security/dmvpn with the following request payload: { \"columns\" : [ \"id\" , \"sn\" , \"hostname\" , \"siteKey\" , \"siteName\" , \"peerNbma\" , \"peerTunnel\" , \"state\" , \"time\" , \"attrb\" ], \"filters\" : { \"state\" : [ \"color\" , \"eq\" , \"0\" ]}, \"snapshot\" : \"$last\" , \"reports\" : \"/technology/security/dmvpn\" } This will retrieve a dictionary with the data from the columns listed in the technology table from the last snapshot, filtered on the value of the \u201cstate\u201d column equalling 0 - which equates to the colour green from the validation check. Note that snapshot management is referred to in a separate article - the \u2018$last\u2019 snapshot may not be the best to query on in all cases.","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"IP_Fabric_API/retrieving_configurations/","text":"Retrieving configurations This tech note describes how you can retrieve configuration files from IP Fabric\u2019s configuration management capability, to be consumed outside the platform.

Using the /graphs endpoint, a successful request returns a JSON response of the form: { \"graphResult\" : { ... }, \"pathlookup\" : { ... } } graphResult The \"graphResult\" construct describes the detail of the topology of the end to end path through the network. It consists of three sections: \"settings\" - echoes the settings from the request body or the system settings as they apply to line styles, colours, weights and labels; hidden device types and groupings \"boxLabels\" - text labels for each of the groups \"graphData\" - a JSON construct containing a list of nodes and edges in the topological view of the path. Takes the form: { \"nodes\" : { ... }, \"edges\" : { ... } } where \"nodes\" contains data relating to the individual nodes in the graph. Each one is assigned a \"vDevice\" ID but there is recorded in each its hostname as \"label\" , it's \"position\" , its serial number in the \"sn\" field and the device \"type\" . Other key:value pairs relate to the inner workings of the IP Fabric graphing process. Example { \"vDevice/111111111\" : { \"boxId\" : \"SITE1\" , \"children\" : [], \"graphType\" : \"pathLookup\" , \"id\" : \"vDevice/111111111\" , \"label\" : \"HOSTNAME\" , \"parentPath\" : null , \"position\" : { \"x\" : 200 , \"y\" : 160 }, \"sn\" : \"SNXXXXXXXX\" , \"type\" : \"switch\" } \"edges\" contains data relating to the connections between the nodes along the data path. Each one is assigned an ID consisting of a combination of the node ID and interface at each end of the edge. The JSON construct also includes labels for the ends and the centre of the line, graphical details like (x,y) positions of the line and arrowheads and the colours and style of the lines. The \"severity_info\" key:value pair contains the information about how the edge conforms to applied intent checks; and the \"packet\" subtree contains a list of the layered packet headers in the simulation as it passes through the edge. Example { \"packet\" : [ { \"dst\" : \"dddd.dddd.dddd\" , \"etherType\" : \"ip\" , \"src\" : \"aaaa.aaaa.aaaa\" , \"type\" : \"ethernet\" , \"vlan\" : 10 }, { \"dst\" : [ \"10.10.20.112\" ], \"protocol\" : \"tcp\" , \"src\" : [ \"10.10.10.112\" ], \"type\" : \"ip\" }, { \"dst\" : [ \"80\" ], \"flags\" : [], \"src\" : [ \"10000\" ], \"type\" : \"tcp\" } ] } pathlookup The \"pathlookup\" construct describes the hop-by-hop forwarding and policy decisions that have been taken to get from source to destination. Notable key:value pairs within that construct include: \"eventSummary\" - which highlights the success or failure of the path and the cause of any issues along the way. \"flags\" will show if any policy has caused the traffic to fail to reach the destination (eg \"acl-deny\" or \"zone-deny\") \"topics\" is a construct to represent the \"Result\" tab in the UI - it shows whether there have been ACL or firewall policies affecting the path, or any issues with forwarding behaviour. Positive values for the \"0\" key show that the decision has allowed traffic to pass; positive values for any of the other keys indicate a failure in the evaluation at some point \"decisions\" - contains a record for each device in the path and the forwarding and policy decision it has to make in the path. For each device: \"trafficIn\" is a representation of the ingress interface and the edge that it is connected to \"trafficOut\" represents the egress interface and the edge that it sends traffic along towards the destination \"traces\" contains the data to represent how that decision was taken - for example that might include: a \"switching-nexthop\" decision in a switch will require a MAC address table match; an \"ip-routing\" decision in a router will require a routing table lookup and an ARP table ; an \"ip-routing\" decision in a zone-based firewall will add in a security check to validate that policy allows the packet to pass; an \"mpls-switching\" decision will validate the VRF, MPLS labels and push/pop behaviour in the label stack; and so on. I've not given any specific examples here as they vary wildly depending on the specifics of your environment. There are also numerous additional fields in the \"pathlookup\" construct which will also be dependent on your particular path check. And there are some key:value pairs which have specific internal usage. But by using trial and error, you should be able to get a good handle on the behaviour of the path lookup using this guidance. From this note, you can see just how much thought and detail has gone into the development of the path lookup process. Hopefully it illustrates how closely IP Fabric models the behaviour of the data plane of network devices to give an accurate view of the impact of the network on forwarding behaviour.

The process is controlled from the discovery tab of the web user interface using the (start) and (stop) buttons. The timing of the network discovery snapshots can be automated in Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Snapshots to collect data in periodic intervals or at a specific time. It is recommended to do a network discovery at least once a day to record all network changes. Connectivity Report A connection to every attempted address either succeeds or is recorded in the Connectivity Report which details the reason for the connection failure. The most frequent reason for failure is a timeout of the login attempt. A connectivity report can be useful for troubleshooting failed credentials and other unreachability reasons. An authentication failure messages denote an unsuccessful login attempt and provide a description of how the device has responded. Bandwidth Limit Bandwidth limit controls the amount of traffic sent to and received from the network infrastructure using bidirectional shaper and application flow control mechanisms. The traffic rate never exceeds the configured limit in either direction, allowing discovery and analysis processes to be run during business hours, thereby not overloading the network infrastructure devices any more than during standard operational procedures. To further distribute the network load and reduce the possibility of the bottlenecks, the connection scheduler sorts connections attempts to addresses that are farthest away. For example, in a list of addresses 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.20.10.1, 10.10.20.1, after attempting a connection to 10.10.10.1, the next IP that will be scheduled is 10.20.10.1, because it shares only 11 bits with 10.10.10.1. This lowest common mask rule enables statistically distributing the load without prior topology knowledge. The selected number of megabits per second also controls the number of simultaneous connections. Each additional megabit adds 3 parallel sessions. Discovery Process Discovery is performed via a lightweight interaction with the network infrastructure using CLI management protocols and ICMP probes. If the initial seed is not entered, the discovery mechanism attempts to login to the default gateway and to responders of ICMP probes returning from the traceroute to the 10.0.0.0 network address. After a successful login, discovery reads the network protocol state tables and looks for known neighbours, such as routing protocol next hops, ARP entries with MAC addresses of supported vendors, and CDP and LLDP neighbour information. A connection attempt is made to each potential network infrastructure device. Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks on the routing table. This is how the discovery process continues after a successful connection to a network device: IP Fabric looks at LLDP/CDP and other neighbour protocols of the discovered device and tries to connect to those devices IP Fabric tries to connect to a next-hop device from the routing table IP Fabric use the device's ARP table to find hosts and other network devices it can connect to with the help of OUI table in IP Fabric (Settings \u2192 OUI) Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks in the routing table. Discovery then collects the detailed network state and information from every discovered device for every supported running protocol. All collected data is timestamped at the reading time and the timestamps are used to calculate the rate of change for each element. Discovery also computes network topology and cross-technology dependencies by using network graph traversals of upstream and downstream paths. A topology for each protocol is computed separately. A managed network is considered to consist of every discovered device under a coherent administrative domain, as restricted by access credentials, and the full list of devices is available in the inventory. The spanning-tree domain is a topology of contiguously connected spanning-tree instances and signifies a Layer 2 failure domain in the case of a cascading Layer 2 failure.

Sites The site inventory provides an overview of discovered sites, the number of devices and users present at the site, and enables the generation of site-specific reports and diagrams. Sites are automatically calculated based on the administrative domain boundaries, such as carrier networks and other unmanaged infrastructure. A single, unmanaged traceroute hop is not considered a site boundary, so unmanaged infrastructure is reconstructed from the probes. The specific method of site boundary calculation can be changed in the settings. The site inventory also enables the renaming of the site. To rename the site, select the site from the list and then click on the \"Rename Site\" button in the pop-up menu above the table. In the popup box, enter the desired site name and click \"Save\". An unknown site is either a collection of isolated devices or when a device forms a single-device site. Devices The device inventory represents all logical managed network infrastructure devices that have been discovered and analyzed. Each entry provides the following information: The site is the logical grouping to which device belongs to, while single-site or isolated devices belong to an unknown site. The routing domain is the contiguous layer 3 routing domain to which the device belongs to. Switching domains are the contiguous layer 2 switching domain the device belongs to. \"Hostname\" is the short name of the device. Serial Number is the serial number of the device.

Also your source network device and its interface can be selected when choosing User defined First Hop Algorithm. Source/Destination IP Address and Port By default, ICMP protocol and Echo request is chosen for path lookup. When switched to Web HTTP/HTTPS, TCP destination port 80 and 443 with (web|http|https) application is selected by default. When extending details, transport protocol and range of ports can be specified for a source and for a destination. When more destination ports are specified, IP Fabric will analyze all of them individually during the pathlookup. TTL and Fragment Offset In More details , TTL (Time to live ) and Fragment offset can be set - thus affecting path lookup - default TTL is 128 and Fragment offset is set to 0 Application When evaluating security rules and security appliances on the path check traffic on L7, an application can be checked on the path lookup. It\u2019s almost impossible to standardize application names across all vendors. You can define your own application name with regular expressions.

For example, for testing authentication credentials from the specific IP address of IP Fabric VM, in case of address-restricted access. The CLI interface is the main tool in servicing the system by the support teams. A first boot wizard can be used to change system settings, such as IP addressing parameters, domain names, NTP, system proxy settings, or a user's password. To launch First Boot Wizard again, connect via SSH to IP Fabric as osadmin user, launch ipfabric-net-wizard and then reboot the system. Command-line also allows the use of the standard networking tools, such as telnet, ssh, traceroute or ping. Troubleshooting VM network problems using IP Fabric CLI In the event of a VM network connection problem, DNS issues, network devices connectivity issue, IP Fabric CLI is a useful helper. CLI can be also used to access system and application logs as well as snapshot files. System and application logs System and application logs are placed in /var/log folder. Specifically IP Fabric application logs can be found in: /var/log/nimpee. Snapshots Snapshots are available in osadmin home directory /home/osadmin/snapshots .

A: IP Fabric is a network analytics platform for multi-vendor environments that automates network discovery, network topology diagrams on a protocol level, network security compliance audit and network documentation. The platform enables an intent-based approach to network management and instant application path simulation over large-scale networks. Q: Why should I use the IP Fabric? A: IP Fabric serves as a single point of truth for all network inventory and protocol data or provide up-to-date network topology diagrams. It speeds up the troubleshooting and root-cause analysis processes with simple network search and end-to-end application path testing. Apart from significant benefits to network administrators, it elevates collaboration with other teams and systems via its standard interfaces and helps to automate network provisioning and the detection of inconsistent protocol states , network loops or security issues based on user-defined rules. Q: Is the IP Fabric a monitoring solution? A: The IP Fabric platform collects data from the network on a regular basis to provide in-depth analytics. The output of the data collection is a digital snapshot of the entire network at the time of discovery. But IP Fabric does not monitor the network in real-time. Q: Why to use the analytical platform, isn't my monitoring suite enough? A: Monitoring tools are still crucial to your network operations processes; raised alerts and alarms will let engineers know there is something to be assessed or investigated. Analytics of the network will give you the ability to compare past states of the network, compare changes, analyze full route-cause of issues to prevent future repeats of the same issues and improve efficiency of troubleshooting processes through an automated tool-set. Installation Q: What is needed for IP Fabric deployment? A: IP Fabric currently operates as a standalone virtual server available for VMware 5.0 and later or Hyper-V hypervisors. (Other hypervisors may be available in the future.) It can be easily deployed with the OVA image provided by IP Fabric. Q: Is the IP Fabric cloud based or on-premise solution? A: IP Fabric is in most cases deployed as an on-premise solution . It doesn\u2019t require any Internet connectivity to operate or verify the license or run discovery. Alternatively, it can be deployed in the cloud and discover networks via private tunnels. Q: Do I need to install any additional virtual machines? A: No additional supporting servers or licenses are needed for successful deployment. Q: Do I need a hardware appliance to install IP Fabric? A: IP Fabric is a virtual appliance that runs on VMware 5.0 or later. It doesn\u2019t need a standalone hardware appliance by design. Q: How's the product licensed? A: The product is licensed on a subscription basis (including support). The only factor we account for in the license price is the number of active network devices (switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, wireless controllers) in the target network. Wireless Access-Points are not included in the license. Operation & Maintenance Q: How many engineers should I allocate to test your solution? A: One engineer is enough to handle the task of deployment and testing. Q: How should I prepare my network for successful discovery? A: IP Fabric collects data via Command-Line Interface (CLI) with SSH/Telnet directly from each network device individually. The best location for virtual machine installation is in the management part of the network with enabled security path over SSH/Telnet protocol from the server\u2019s IP address as a source IP for all session requests. Access-Lists, Firewall filters or related Security policies should be adjusted to enable the connection. Q: What is the impact on the network during discovery? A: The overall impact is very low on network resources . IP Fabric is reading all data from a device with a single SSH session in a similar way as the administrator, only faster. It is very common for IP Fabric to run discovery during business hours when little to no irregularities were observed in monitoring. Q: How does the platform collect data from network? A: IP Fabric collects data only via Command-Line Interface (CLI) with set of known operational commands on supported network devices. Read-only access is sufficient for discovery. Q: Are you providing real-time information? A: The platform itself provides all analytics information based on regular network scans (the snapshots). It is not a real-time monitoring solution but an analytical tool. Q: What kind of data are you able to collect? A: The platform collects variety of data specific to each network device. Starting with basic inventory and protocol states, detailed protocol tables or links. To provide full transparency, all operational commands used for each vendor/platform are well documented. Q: Does the IP Fabric platform use SNMP to collect data? A: No, IP Fabric doesn\u2019t collect any SNMP data from active network devices. Our CLI\u2013based approach achieves a greater level of detail compared to SNMP. Q: What is needed for starting the very first network discovery? A: For the very first network discovery, IP Fabric needs to be deployed with the OVA image (provided by us on request). Then the platform needs to have correct credentials to access active network devices via SSH/Telnet. The security perimeter needs to enable communication from the IP Fabric platform to network devices for mentioned CLI protocols. And optionally, you can provide a single IP address as a starting point for discovery. Q: What types of network devices can IP Fabric discover? A: IP Fabric can discover all supported IP based active network devices , in general it\u2019s switches, routers, firewalls, load-balancers, wan concentrators, wireless controllers, wireless access-points. Supported manufacturers Q: What network vendors are currently supported? A: IP Fabric is a powerful tool for multivendor, large-scale networks. The network vendor list is ever-expanding with new items added each release. Complete support matrix can be found in our Support Matrix. Q: What if I have unsupported vendor in my network? A: If there is a vendor in your network that is currently not included in the supported matrix, it won\u2019t be discovered and will be listed as unmanaged neighbor in the platform. We are implementing new vendors with almost every release, so feel free to ask your IP Fabric sales or technical representative about the road-map priorities for the next phase. Support for the vendor in question may have already been road-mapped.","title":"Frequently Asked Question - FAQ"},{"location":"tips/Frequently_Asked_Question_-_FAQ/#frequently-asked-question-faq","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Question - FAQ"},{"location":"tips/Frequently_Asked_Question_-_FAQ/#business-goals","text":"Q: What is the IP Fabric platform?
