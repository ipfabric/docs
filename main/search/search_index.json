The lightweight discovery capabilities (through SSH or telnet) quickly detect the current network state, including detailed data for each address and port. A network model of gathered data reconstructs the topologies for each switching and routing protocol to enable a cross-technology analysis of upstream and downstream relationships. Dependencies and dependents are calculated for each network element, allowing analysis to represent each aspect of the network in the context of productivity impact on the downstream hosts and on network devices, while the immediate productivity impact of performance and capacity is calculated for each user and every element. Architecture A distributed system of micro-service components resides within IP Fabric VM, all based around a multi-model database with a mathematical network model at its core. Operating system-level controls provide high availability, security and log collection. The kernel-level bidirectional traffic shaper and application-level worker flow control mechanisms provide comprehensive traffic management and automatically respond to any sign of network congestion to ensure that only freely available bandwidth is utilized. The user interface is available on port 443 of the VM's IP address through any modern web browser and on any screen. Table output can be exported into CSV format for further processing, and selected reports are exportable into Word format. Operational Requirements Hardware Requirements The IP Fabric platform runs on any x64 CPU with following instructions: avx,popcnt,sse,sse2,sse4.1,sse4.2,sse4a,ssse3 . The system runs in at least 4 parallel threads, but scheduling can handle operations even down to a single thread. IP Fabric uses less than 4GB of RAM when idle, and an additional 12GB of RAM is required for collected network information. The base installation requires 80GB of HDD space and an additional 50MB per device for the network. Minimum requirements are: CPU RAM HDD 4C 16 GB 90GB The following table represents the recommended hardware requirements for optimal performance of the platform based on the number of network infrastructure devices in the network. Devices CPU RAM HDD 500 4 16 GB 90 GB 1 000 4 32 GB 100 GB 2 000 8 64 GB 200 GB 5 000 12 64 GB 300 GB 10 000 16 128 GB 550 GB 20 000 18 256 GB 1 000 GB Additional resources requirements To make sure you have enough resources, please use the following formulas. Data disk storage requires 1MB per device per each snapshot (example: 1350 devices, plan is to keep up to 100 snapshots => 135 GB data storage). Memory requires 5MB of RAM per device per each loaded snapshot (example: 1200 devices, up to 100 snapshots but only 3 loaded at a time (1200 x 5 = 6000 x 3) => 18 GB RAM). Note The recommended hardware resources may not allow running the most demanding graph traversal functions. These functions may require a sizable memory pool to complete successfully. Network Connectivity Requirements During the snapshot operations, the user can control network bandwidth limit which never exceeds an aggregate of set bandwidths in any direction to provide an additional safety measure. IP Fabric should be connected to a network that has direct connectivity to managed devices. Jumphost server can also be set-up and used. (Jumphost server requires an installation of SSH Python version 3.6+.)

Network Access Credentials Requirements Network Device Access IP Fabric accesses network-infrastructure devices via CLI (command-line interface) using SSH or TELNET protocols. All device interaction is accounted on the platform and only \"read-only\" or \"operator\" group privilege level 1 credentials are required. The following list contains an example of commands used for Cisco IOS: terminal length 0 show version show inventory show etherchannel summary show interfaces [status|switchport] show ip int [brief] show ip vrf show ip arp show ip route show ip cef show ip access-list show cdp neighbors detail show lldp neighbors detail show mac address-table show spanning-tree [detail|mst|summary] show standby [brief] show vrrp [brief] show vlan brief In the beginning, IP Fabric fingerprints the device using the \"show version\" command (or equivalent) to identify a vendor and a system version. A \"terminal length\" command is optional but highly recommended, as it greatly improves the speed of the device interaction, reduces the load on the network and the device, and improves collection precision. Additional Device Access Since firewalls do not follow privilege levels, it may be necessary to explicitly specify the commands allowed for each user. The following list specifies the exec-mode commands needed for firewall discovery. show version show interface show route show arp show context terminal pager 0 Turning off paging greatly improves the speed of the discovery and allows a terminal pager command, making it highly recommended although not mandatory. The commands can be allowed through the central TACACS or RADIUS access control system, or they can be configured locally on a device. The following example adds the necessary commands to a privilege-1 user: privilege show level 1 mode exec command interface privilege show level 1 mode exec command arp privilege show level 1 mode exec command route privilege show level 1 mode exec command context privilege cmd level 1 mode exec command terminal List of all commands used for CLI discovery can be found in this feature/vendor matrix . Staging vs Production Deployment IP Fabric is a complex solution with multiple moving parts. We thoroughly test every release before it is made available to our customers. Testing comprises of the automated unit testing on the code level and automated tests run against various physical and virtual lab environments. These emulate complex networks with many devices from multiple vendors. Despite these efforts, issues can still arise after deploying a new version of IP Fabric to the customer's environment. For example, it is not feasible to replicate the entire network or a combination of particular device models. Therefore, we suggest 2-stage deployment of the new IP Fabric releases for complex or critical implementations. The first stage is staging deployment, used to verify the functionality of the new release within the customer's environment. Info You will need a valid license for the staging deployment. Please, contact our sales team to check eligibility for a free complimentary license. The second stage is the deployment to the production / live environment. The staging environment's sizing follows the suggestions mentioned above for a standard deployment. We don't provide special staging builds. These are regular production builds, which are just deployed separately not to potentially disrupt the day-to-day use of IP Fabric within the organization. We suggest that you make staging as close as possible to the final production environment. The staging environment should discover the same devices as the production (e.g., there is only a limited value if the staging environment \"sees\" only 500 network devices, while the whole network consists of thousands of devices). On the other side, it is perfectly fine to provision the staging environment dynamically if your deployment environment allows it. Also, a typical \"acceptance test\" on the staging environment lasts only a couple of days to verify overall functionality.","title":"IP Fabric Overview"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/#ip-fabric-overview","text":"The IP Fabric network infrastructure management platform provides on-demand network discovery, advanced analytics, and detailed engineering visibility.

A: IP Fabric is a network analytics platform for multi-vendor environments that automates network discovery, network topology diagrams on a protocol level, network security compliance audit and network documentation. The platform enables an intent-based approach to network management and instant application path simulation over large-scale networks. Q: Why should I use the IP Fabric? A: IP Fabric serves as a single point of truth for all network inventory and protocol data or provide up-to-date network topology diagrams. It speeds up the troubleshooting and root-cause analysis processes with simple network search and end-to-end application path testing. Apart from significant benefits to network administrators, it elevates collaboration with other teams and systems via its standard interfaces and helps to automate network provisioning and the detection of inconsistent protocol states , network loops or security issues based on user-defined rules. Q: Is the IP Fabric a monitoring solution? A: The IP Fabric platform collects data from the network on a regular basis to provide in-depth analytics. The output of the data collection is a digital snapshot of the entire network at the time of discovery. But IP Fabric does not monitor the network in real-time. Q: Why to use the analytical platform, isn't my monitoring suite enough? A: Monitoring tools are still crucial to your network operations processes; raised alerts and alarms will let engineers know there is something to be assessed or investigated. Analytics of the network will give you the ability to compare past states of the network, compare changes, analyze full route-cause of issues to prevent future repeats of the same issues and improve efficiency of troubleshooting processes through an automated tool-set. Installation Q: What is needed for IP Fabric deployment? A: IP Fabric currently operates as a standalone virtual server available for VMware 5.0 and later or Hyper-V hypervisors. (Other hypervisors may be available in the future.) It can be easily deployed with the OVA image provided by IP Fabric. Q: Is the IP Fabric cloud based or on-premise solution? A: IP Fabric is in most cases deployed as an on-premise solution . It doesn\u2019t require any Internet connectivity to operate or verify the license or run discovery. Alternatively, it can be deployed in the cloud and discover networks via private tunnels. Q: Do I need to install any additional virtual machines? A: No additional supporting servers or licenses are needed for successful deployment. Q: Do I need a hardware appliance to install IP Fabric? A: IP Fabric is a virtual appliance that runs on VMware 6.5 or later. It doesn\u2019t need a standalone hardware appliance by design. Q: How's the product licensed? A: The product is licensed on a subscription basis (including support). The only factor we account for in the license price is the number of active network devices (switches, routers, firewalls, load balancers, wireless controllers) in the target network. Wireless Access-Points are not included in the license. Operation & Maintenance Q: How many engineers should I allocate to test your solution? A: One engineer is enough to handle the task of deployment and testing. Q: How should I prepare my network for successful discovery? A: IP Fabric collects data via Command-Line Interface (CLI) with SSH/Telnet directly from each network device individually. The best location for virtual machine installation is in the management part of the network with enabled security path over SSH/Telnet protocol from the server\u2019s IP address as a source IP for all session requests. Access-Lists, Firewall filters or related Security policies should be adjusted to enable the connection. Q: What is the impact on the network during discovery? A: The overall impact is very low on network resources . IP Fabric is reading all data from a device with a single SSH session in a similar way as the administrator, only faster. It is very common for IP Fabric to run discovery during business hours when little to no irregularities were observed in monitoring. Q: How does the platform collect data from network? A: IP Fabric collects data only via Command-Line Interface (CLI) with set of known operational commands on supported network devices. Read-only access is sufficient for discovery. Q: Are you providing real-time information? A: The platform itself provides all analytics information based on regular network scans (the snapshots). It is not a real-time monitoring solution but an analytical tool. Q: What kind of data are you able to collect? A: The platform collects variety of data specific to each network device. Starting with basic inventory and protocol states, detailed protocol tables or links. To provide full transparency, all operational commands used for each vendor/platform are well documented. Q: Does the IP Fabric platform use SNMP to collect data? A: No, IP Fabric doesn\u2019t collect any SNMP data from active network devices. Our CLI\u2013based approach achieves a greater level of detail compared to SNMP. Q: What is needed for starting the very first network discovery? A: For the very first network discovery, IP Fabric needs to be deployed with the OVA image (provided by us on request). Then the platform needs to have correct credentials to access active network devices via SSH/Telnet. The security perimeter needs to enable communication from the IP Fabric platform to network devices for mentioned CLI protocols. And optionally, you can provide a single IP address as a starting point for discovery. Q: What types of network devices can IP Fabric discover? A: IP Fabric can discover all supported IP based active network devices , in general it\u2019s switches, routers, firewalls, load-balancers, wan concentrators, wireless controllers, wireless access-points. Supported manufacturers Q: What network vendors are currently supported? A: IP Fabric is a powerful tool for multi-vendor, large-scale networks. The network vendor list is ever-expanding with new items added each release. Complete support matrix can be found in our Support Matrix . Q: What if I have unsupported vendor in my network? A: If there is a vendor in your network that is currently not included in the supported matrix, it won\u2019t be discovered and will be listed as unmanaged neighbor in the platform. We are implementing new vendors with almost every release, so feel free to ask your IP Fabric sales or technical representative about the road-map priorities for the next phase. Support for the vendor in question may have already been road-mapped. Data at Rest Encryption Q: Is IP Fabric's VM encrypted? A:No, it isn't. It would add unnecessary level of complexity for both IP Fabric engineers and the client. Encryption key provisioning would need to be solved in case that filesystem or underlying block device is encrypted. This would require either passphrase prompt on every boot or integration into secret store on the deployment infrastructure side. We recommend the client handles encryption on storage level (e.g. VMware Datastore). Q: Is IP Fabric storing everything as a plain text? A:No, it isn't. Passwords at rest in the database and techsupports are encrypted to ensure safety of the customer's private data.","title":"Frequently Asked Question - FAQ"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/faq/#frequently-asked-question-faq","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Question - FAQ"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/faq/#business-goals","text":"Q: What is the IP Fabric platform?

The timing of the network discovery snapshots can be automated in Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 Snapshots to collect data in periodic intervals or at a specific time. It is recommended to do a network discovery at least once a day to record all network changes. Connectivity Report A connection to every attempted address either succeeds or is recorded in the Connectivity Report which details the reason for the connection failure. The most frequent reason for failure is a timeout of the login attempt. A connectivity report can be useful for troubleshooting failed credentials and other unreachability reasons. An authentication failure messages denote an unsuccessful login attempt and provide a description of how the device has responded. Bandwidth Limit Bandwidth limit controls the amount of traffic sent to and received from the network infrastructure using bidirectional shaper and application flow control mechanisms. The traffic rate never exceeds the configured limit in either direction, allowing discovery and analysis processes to be run during business hours, thereby not overloading the network infrastructure devices any more than during standard operational procedures. To further distribute the network load and reduce the possibility of the bottlenecks, the connection scheduler sorts connections attempts to addresses that are farthest away. For example, in a list of addresses 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, 10.20.10.1, 10.10.20.1 , after attempting a connection to 10.10.10.1 , the next IP scheduled is 10.20.10.1 , because it shares only 11 bits with 10.10.10.1 . This lowest common mask rule enables statistically distributing the load without prior topology knowledge. The selected number of megabits per second also controls the number of simultaneous connections. Each additional megabit adds 3 parallel sessions. Discovery Process Discovery is performed via a lightweight interaction with the network infrastructure using CLI management protocols and ICMP probes. If the initial seed is not entered, the discovery mechanism attempts to login to the default gateway and to responders of ICMP probes returning from the traceroute to the 10.0.0.0 network address. After a successful login, discovery reads the network protocol state tables and looks for known neighbours, such as routing protocol next hops, ARP entries with MAC addresses of supported vendors, and CDP and LLDP neighbour information. A connection attempt is made to each potential network infrastructure device. Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks on the routing table. This is how the discovery process continues after a successful connection to a network device: IP Fabric looks at LLDP/CDP and other neighbor protocols of the discovered device and tries to connect to those devices IP Fabric tries to connect to a next-hop device from the routing table IP Fabric use the device's ARP table to find hosts and other network devices it can connect to with the help of OUI table in IP Fabric ( Settings \u2192 OUI ) Traceroute is attempted for each unknown connected router from the discovered networks in the routing table. Discovery then collects the detailed network state and information from every discovered device for every supported running protocol.

Settings The below topics will be describing the Global Settings however users can make adjustments to specific Snapshots. Making changes to the Global Settings and then testing them in a previous snapshot may not apply your changes. Here are two methods for testing settings. Make your changes in the Snapshot specific Settings and then Add Devices (or Rediscover timed out devices ). If these changes fixed your issue, then apply them globally. Make your changes globally and then run a new Snapshot. You could also filter the allowed discovery scope in the Snapshot specific Settings to a subset of /32 addresses to speed up discovery. In the example below I am telling discovery only to test 1 device. Discovery Seed These are self-defined IP Addresses that IP Fabric will try to connect to and discover. If a device is successfully discovered it will check the settings in the Discovery Tasks Settings to see what technologies to use to discover neighbors. If you have remote locations possibly through a WAN that is not owned by you, this would be the location to put the IP Addresses of some of your devices so IP Fabric can discover and crawl that site. Important Adding new devices here will only discover them if Limit discovery to already discovered devices is not enabled in the Discovery Tasks Settings. Management > Discovery History The Discovery History table is also used by IP Fabric as the seed addresses. Once a device is discovered in a snapshot it will be placed in this table for use in other snapshots. The username last successfully used for a device will be recorded here and be the first one tried in a future snapshot. If unsuccessful it will check the Settings > Authentication list and go back through the decision tree. This may cause the next snapshot to take longer due to authentication failures but once this table is updated with the new username the discovery time will return to normal. If you have removed devices from your network IP Fabric will still try to connect to them because the IP addresses are defined as seeds in this Discovery History table. To speed up discovery you could delete stale records. You can also filter on Last discovery time and delete records older than X months. Settings > Advanced Discovery \u2013 IP Scope IP Scope tells IP Fabric which networks to include or exclude in the discovery process. The default is set to include everything (0.0.0.0/0). When IP Fabric discovers a neighbor in this network it will try to log in and discover it. If the IP address is not in the include or is in the exclude list then it will not try to connect and discover the device. The exclude list is a great way to exclude networks managed by a different department or perhaps vendors or devices that IPF does not currently support. For instance a customer had discovery hanging due to it trying to log into a terminal server which IPF could not understand; once added to the exclude list the discovery completed successfully. Important Do not confuse the Include List with the Seed list. Include will only try to discover an IP if it is found through the Discovery task or the IP in the seeds. Also note IP Fabric does not do any ICMP pings to find hosts so having a /16 here will not send massive amounts of pings. Discovery Tasks Settings Discovery Tasks Settings is where the magic happens for automated discovery of new devices on your network. If you are not finding new devices in your snapshot ensure Limit discovery to already discovered devices is not enabled . If this is enabled then only devices in the Discovery History table will be added to the snapshot and no new devices ( even if those devices are manually added to the Settings > Discovery Seed ). If you want to limit to only discovered devices but want to add new devices this is still possible by going to Discovery Snapshot and manually adding devices into a snapshot which it will then be added to the Discovery History table and picked up in future snapshots. xDP (neighbors) signifies using CDP or LLDP information to discover devices in your network. ARP uses the ARP and MAC Address OUI information to find devices. If the OUI is set for Enabled for discovery in the Settings > OUI table then IP Fabric will attempt to connect and discover the device. Routing Table will try to connect to next-hop devices. Trace signifies using traceroute to RFC1918 addresses to help discover your internal network. This is helpful for the VM as IPF might not be able to log into the default gateway (vRouter) but using traceroute it can find some other physical devices in the network to use as starting points. SSH/Telnet Please see SSH/TELNET for explanation of these settings. Vendors API Please see Vendors API as each vendor has different requirements. Settings > Authentication Authentication is where you define the username and password IP Fabric uses to connect a physical device (devices discovered through the API are managed through Advanced > Vendors API ). Ensure that you have a username configured for all scopes of the network you wish to discover or set to the default of 0.0.0.0/0 . Tip If you are having issues with Configuration Backup not pulling data ensure that you have Use for configuration management set on the proper usernames. Further information can be located at Authentication . Troubleshooting Missing Devices There can been a numerous amount of reason why IP Fabric did not discover a device from Day 0 or incorrectly configured devices, AAA outage, or insufficient authorization privileges to name a few. First we will take a look at some tables to help you find these and then show how to use the Connectivity Report to debug them. Technology Tables CDP/LLDP > Unmanaged neighbors This is the best table to start as not only do you see the local host and interface names but also the remote hostname, interface name, and remote IP. Since devices can connect to multiple other devices it is possible of duplicate remote hostnames in this list. You are able to export this view to CSV and then remove duplicate hostnames to get a unique list of devices. For instance in this demo I see a total of 59 unmanaged neighbors but only 40 unique remote hostnames. Interfaces > Connectivity matrix > Unmanaged Neighbors Detail This table shows you unmanaged neighbors based many protocols and has a built-in default Intent Check for you. RED : Provides a list of unmanaged CDP/LLDP neighbors ( cdp|lldp|mndp ). This does not provide you with the remote hostname which is why it is recommended to look at this table second. AMBER : Is a list of unmanaged Interior Gateway Protocols ( eigrp|ospf|rip|isis|pim|vxlan|cef ). It is specified as such because if you have a neighbor adjacency with an iGP it is assumed it is under the control of your network. Tip Check this table for help locating rogue devices in your network. BLUE : Is the default rule if the protocol does not match any other regex. GREEN : Is defined for the Exterior Gateway Protocol BGP. Auditing using an External Network Management System Perhaps you would like to audit IP Fabric (or vice versa) using an NMS. This can be done as all the tables can return the data in CSV format via the UI or JSON using the API. This would perhaps help you find other missing devices IP Fabric could not discover. Tip Don\u2019t forget to audit your NMS or alarming systems inventory from what IP Fabric discovered on the network. Many customers have found devices that were not being monitored. Note on Management IP In IPF v4.3.5 or below the UI in many places has a column of Management IP ; in v4.4 this has been renamed to Login IP to avoid confusion and to match the API column name of loginIp . Since IP Fabric is an automated discovery process it will try to log into any IP address found during the discovery tasks processes. This value could be a Loopback, management, physical, or virtual interface. Auditing your external NMS will need extra care as in many cases the IP\u2019s will not match. One solution is to export your NMS inventory to Excel and the Technology > Addressing > Managed IP table to CSV and then perform vlookups between the two datasets. Since the Managed IP contains all the IP addresses found on devices the NMS data should find a match. Another option is to use the device\u2019s Serial Number. Serial numbers are not always unique and there is a chance of overlap so please take this into account. Note on Serial Numbers IP Fabric records two Serial Numbers for the device. The column name Serial Number is the actual hardware serial number of the device which is why it is labeled snHw in the API. The column name Unique serial number is an IP Fabric unique identifier and primary key for the device. This API column name is sn so it is easy to confuse the two if you were not aware. The main time there are differences between the two is seen in firewalls with virtual contexts, vdoms, etc. Connectivity Report The Connectivity Report is a per Snapshot report stating the successes or errors of IP addresses that IP Fabric tried to discover. Once you have a list of IP Addresses from the unmanaged neighbor tables above or perhaps an external Network Management System this is where you would start your troubleshooting process. The most common reason why a new installation of IP Fabric will not connect is due to the connect ECONNREFUSED XX.XX.XX.XX:22 error which signifies the traffic is being blocked by an ACL or Firewall. This is why it is recommend having IP Fabric in your management subnet which is already allowed for remote access to devices so you do not have to re-configure all your ACLs. Another option is to use a jumphost and documentation can be found at Jumphost settings . Another common error is due to Authentication or Authorization errors. Please ensure that the username configured has the correct permissions. There is also a list of CLI commands used which can help ensure authorization is correct. If you find other errors you can refer to this document Connectivity report - Type of Error and the CLI output of the device is usually helpful as well. If you need further assistance please feel free to reach out to your Systems Engineer or open a ticket following the Technical Support instructions. Finally another option for testing devices is to log into the IP Fabric CLI using the osadmin account and manually trying SSH\u2019ing into your devices preferably using the username and password the system was configured to use. If you cannot open a connection this is due to an external reason. Further information can be found at No Devices Discovered . Troubleshooting Configuration Management Configuration Management is a separate process from discovery. First a device must be discover in a Snapshot and placed in the Management > Discovery History table. Once in this table then next time IP Fabric is scheduled to pull configs it should be populated in the list. Example Settings > Advanced > Snapshots is set to periodically create snapshots every day at 6AM Settings > Advanced > Configuration Management is set to periodically create snapshots every day at 11PM New device will be found at 6AM but since the config mgmt is scheduled for 11PM you will need to wait until the next day to ensure it was pulled. Other troubleshooting tips: Please ensure that in Settings > Authentication you have enabled the correct usernames to Use for configuration management , if no usernames have this enabled then configs will not be backed up. Ensure the users have proper authorization for pulling configs.","title":"Troubleshooting Discovery"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/How_Discovery_Works/troubleshooting_discovery/#troubleshooting-discovery","text":"Documentation on most commonly seen discovery issues and how to resolve them.","title":"Troubleshooting Discovery"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/How_Discovery_Works/troubleshooting_discovery/#settings","text":"The below topics will be describing the Global Settings however users can make adjustments to specific Snapshots.

Note on Management IP In IPF v4.3.5 or below the UI in many places has a column of Management IP ; in v4.4 this has been renamed to Login IP to avoid confusion and to match the API column name of loginIp . Since IP Fabric is an automated discovery process it will try to log into any IP address found during the discovery tasks processes. This value could be a Loopback, management, physical, or virtual interface. Auditing your external NMS will need extra care as in many cases the IP\u2019s will not match. One solution is to export your NMS inventory to Excel and the Technology > Addressing > Managed IP table to CSV and then perform vlookups between the two datasets. Since the Managed IP contains all the IP addresses found on devices the NMS data should find a match. Another option is to use the device\u2019s Serial Number. Serial numbers are not always unique and there is a chance of overlap so please take this into account. Note on Serial Numbers IP Fabric records two Serial Numbers for the device. The column name Serial Number is the actual hardware serial number of the device which is why it is labeled snHw in the API. The column name Unique serial number is an IP Fabric unique identifier and primary key for the device. This API column name is sn so it is easy to confuse the two if you were not aware. The main time there are differences between the two is seen in firewalls with virtual contexts, vdoms, etc.","title":"Auditing using an External Network Management System"},{"location":"Getting_Started/Overview/How_Discovery_Works/troubleshooting_discovery/#connectivity-report","text":"The Connectivity Report is a per Snapshot report stating the successes or errors of IP addresses that IP Fabric tried to discover. Once you have a list of IP Addresses from the unmanaged neighbor tables above or perhaps an external Network Management System this is where you would start your troubleshooting process. The most common reason why a new installation of IP Fabric will not connect is due to the connect ECONNREFUSED XX.XX.XX.XX:22 error which signifies the traffic is being blocked by an ACL or Firewall. This is why it is recommend having IP Fabric in your management subnet which is already allowed for remote access to devices so you do not have to re-configure all your ACLs. Another option is to use a jumphost and documentation can be found at Jumphost settings . Another common error is due to Authentication or Authorization errors. Please ensure that the username configured has the correct permissions. There is also a list of CLI commands used which can help ensure authorization is correct. If you find other errors you can refer to this document Connectivity report - Type of Error and the CLI output of the device is usually helpful as well. If you need further assistance please feel free to reach out to your Systems Engineer or open a ticket following the Technical Support instructions. Finally another option for testing devices is to log into the IP Fabric CLI using the osadmin account and manually trying SSH\u2019ing into your devices preferably using the username and password the system was configured to use. If you cannot open a connection this is due to an external reason.

A site can be a branch, a factory, a production floor, a campus, or anything that might represent a logical group for a user. By default, the Site distribution is generated automatically after the discovery process ends and is based on the rules described below. It can also be triggered manually without the need for the whole discovery process by going to Settings \u2192 Site separation (In global or Snapshot settings) . Manual Site Separation (Device Attributes) The Manual Site Separation enables the Device Attributes feature to create manual separation if a device does not follow a standard hostname rule or perhaps the hostname is duplicated in multiple locations. To configure Device Attributes first enable the toggle in the Site Separation Menu and select Configure or the Device Attributes menu under settings. Device Attributes Serial Number is IP Fabric\u2019s \"Unique Serial Number\" (API column sn ); this is not the column \"Serial Number\" which represents the Hardware SN (API column snHw ) Devices discovered via API can also be assigned using Device Attributes. Hostname is populated by IP Fabric when a device matching the Serial Number is found Attribute is the Device Attribute to assign, since we want to set the Site based on the serial number set it to Site name Value is the attribute\u2019s value to assign, in this case we want to split site L35 into separate sites named 35COLO, 35PRODUCTION, 35HEADOFFICE Creating Rules In The UI You are able to create rules in the UI by selecting the Add attribute button. This will provide you a form to fill out. The dropdown is intuitive and will let you search based on SN or hostname. Currently there is an issue where IP Fabric will not search for devices discovered via an API in the UI. Even though it appears no devices match the SN it will still perform the site separation correctly on the next snapshot. Creating Rules Via The API This is the preferred method of creating rules as it allows for bulk importing. Method PUT URL https://<IPF_URL>/api/v5.0/attributes/global Data {\"attributes\": [{\"sn\": \"<IPF SERIAL NUMBER>\", \"value\": \"<SITE NAME>\", \"name\": \"siteName\"}]} Routing And Switching Domain Note With this setting, you can manually edit the distribution of sites later. Sites can be also renamed. By default, the site is comprised of the topology of all contiguously interconnected protocols, and the boundary of a site is formed by the network protocol relation that is not under management using the provided authentication credentials. The default separation is useful for MPLS networks where directly connected routing infrastructure at the site\u2019s edge is not accessible. For situations where an inaccessible routed firewall is used at the site (i.e. device under different management team), an option Firewall at site can be turned on so the infrastructure before and behind the firewall is not separated into two different sites. For networks that have direct routing connectivity between sites, such as DMVPN or Leased Lines (usually over Serial or MFR interfaces), an option to separate the site using tunnel and/or serial the interface should be selected. Regular Expression Site Separation Hint Site distribution cannot be changed manually when regex rules are used. Sites cannot be renamed. Alternatively, site separation can follow a specific Regular Expression (RegEx) where separation will be performed based on portion of a device hostname or SNMP location. Note If you cannot cover the names of the sites with one regex, you can use logical or. Use | (pipe) the character between RegEx rules or use the Device Attributes method shown below. Hostname Regex Go to Settings \u2192 Site separation and change Routing & Switching Domain to RegEx based on hostname or create a new rule by Add rule button. Transform hostname is used to normalize site names based on hostname: Upper case (default) - first hostname PRAGUE-RTR1 , second hostname prague-rtr2 => result is that both devices in one site named PRAGUE Lower case - first hostname PRAGUE-RTR1 , second hostname prague-rtr2 => result is that both devices in one site named prague No transformation - first hostname PRAGUE-RTR1 , second hostname prague-rtr2 => result is that each device has its own site named PRAGUE and prague In this example the regular expression will match items such as PRAGUE-, LONDON-, etc. SNMP Location Regex Go to Settings \u2192 Site separation and change Routing & Switching Domain to RegEx based on SNMP location or create a new rule by Add rule button. Testing The UI now allows you to edit and test your rules directly in the browser when selecting the Test rule option. Here you can see a live preview of devices that will match the regex you created. You can also test SNMP location rules: Regex Example We have several locations whose name is logically designed as one letter with one to three numbers. From the point of view of a regex, such a site can generally be expressed as \" ^([a-zA-Z]\\d{1,3}) \". Unfortunately, we have two other sites that do not fit into this schema. These sites can be defined with their own regex and this can be added to the original one using the logical operator or : ^([a-zA-Z]\\d{1,3}|HWLAB|static\\d{1}) - 1st option OR 2nd option OR 3rd option Device Neighborship This option will try to define a device based on its neighbor relationship if a device does not match any previous rule. Perhaps you have devices in your environment that do not follow the normal standard like in a DMZ zone or Day 0 devices that have not been fully configured. If that device is connected to a device that did match a rule, IP Fabric will intelligently group it to the correct site.

Descriptions and allowed methods are coming soon. For more information about IP Fabric API, please visit generated IP Fabric API documentation .

Part 4: Diagramming Utilizing the official IP Fabric Python Diagramming SDK to automate creation of Network and Path Lookup Diagrams. API Versioning We have adopted a rather fast-moving API versioning schema starting with release 5.0 . This allows for tighter control over the changes and provides opportunity for maintaining a backwards compatibility for a manageable time frame. Design still leverages API version directly in URL over alternative approaches, such as extended Accept header. This allows for unambiguous exchange of state between IPF and customers, nothing more then URL is needed to identify the resource being accessed. URL Schema a Version in URL URL schema looks like https:// { hostname } /api/v { major } . { minor } / { resource_path } we use the following shortened version throughout the documentation: /api/ { api_version } / { resource_path } where major and minor follows the release version of the platform. So, if the 4.4.3 version of the IP Fabric platform is deployed, its latest API path would be /api/v4.4/ . The whole .{minor} is optional and it is treated as 0 if omitted. {api_version} stands for the complete version string, for example v5.1 . Please, mind the v prefix. API version deprecation and allowed changes IPF commits to keep support for all minor versions within the particular major version (so for example in release 5.4.3 we allow /api/v5.1/ calls). But API may break between major releases. We call major release a release which introduces some complex functionality. This typically means a large code refactoring, changes of data model etc. took place. Keeping the backwards compatibility is frequently not feasible in such cases (for example v3 brought support for snapshots, v4 brought graphs, v5 RBAC). Naturally backwards compatible changes (typically addition of a new attribute) don\u2019t need to be gated and can appear in responses even when older API version is used within the request. Changes and depreciations are communicated via API documentation and Release Notes . We will mark attributes as deprecated: true in the OpenAPI schema, when we fully migrate to OpenAPI 3.0+ specification. Responses made with minor < release_minor will contain a custom header warning client about use of potentially old API. We leverage the IETF Draft for Deprecation header . It is included, and set to true ( Deprecation: true ) in every response to call made with older then current API version. Requests made with major < release_major (obsolete version) will be refused with HTTP code 410 Gone (also 406 Not Acceptable would be reasonable, but we explicitly mention this in the apidoc in relationship with Accept header, so not to confuse these two the 410 was selected). Requests made with API version newer than the currently supported version are also refused with 410 Gone (while 404 or 406 would be probably closer semantically, we don\u2019t want to confuse clients, and keep 410 for all version related errors). Error body, in both cases, is a JSON depicting current platform version as well as the current API version: { \"message\" : \"Unsupported API version used.\" , \"release_version\" : \"5.4.2+1\" , \"api_version\" : \"v5.4\" } This may look excessive at first, but it is to promote the client code to be changed with every update, as to keep track with all small changes and updates we bring. But in reality, clients would be typically fine, if they update API version when moving to the new major release only. Frequently, the client code is actually not going to change except of the API version. Thus we recommend using a global constant for it. API Authentication Majority of API calls need to be authenticated. API Token needs to be passed as a request header Content-Type: application/json X-API-Token: YOUR_API_TOKEN_GENERATED_VIA_IPFABRIC_UI Technology Table Endpoints The technology tables use POST requests only for reading information and the payload is used to specify or filter requested data from listed tables.

To ensure working graphs please ensure python-ipfabric-diagrams Major and Minor version matches your IP Fabric version. https://github.com/community-fabric/python-ipfabric-diagrams For example when using release 5.0 use pip install -U ipfabric-diagrams==5.0.* to install appropriate package. API Endpoints {api_url_prefix}/graphs - for JSON output {api_url_prefix}/graphs/svg - for SVG vector image output {api_url_prefix}/graphs/png - for PNG bitmap image output POST Request Requests are made using a POST to the endpoint listed above for the desired output. The body of the request contains the JSON described in the next section. Request Body Contains a JSON data structure with the keys snapshot [mandatory] - A quoted string containing the ID of the required snapshot. Can also use the reserved strings $last , $prev and $lastLocked parameters [mandatory] - A nested JSON data structure with keys positions [optional] - A nested JSON data structure consisting of keys representing the serial number of devices and their positions in the completed diagram. Origin of x=0, y=0 is the top left of the resulting image. Sample position data structure { \"positions\" : { \"SNXXXXXXXXX\" : { \"x\" : 40 , \"y\" : 160 } } } settings [optional] - A nested JSON data structure representing visualisation settings to override the default view in IP Fabric's diagram canvas. In these settings, it is possible to: change edge properties like colours and thickness of lines representing protocols and groups change labels on the edges and interfaces hide certain device types. Example settings data structure { \"settings\" : { \"edges\" : [ { \"id\" : \"6129bb53-d19d-47ee-8f45-8829073221c1\" , \"name\" : \"vxlan\" , \"type\" : \"pathLookupEdge\" , \"grouped\" : false , \"style\" : { \"color\" : \"#d4b524\" , \"pattern\" : \"solid\" , \"thicknessThresholds\" : [ 2 , 4 , 8 ] }, \"visible\" : true , \"labels\" : [ \"intName\" , \"protocol\" ] } ] } } Response If the PNG or SVG endpoints are selected, the request returns a binary File representing the desired output. Using the /graphs endpoint, a successful request returns a JSON response of the form: { \"graphResult\" : { ... }, \"pathlookup\" : { ... } } graphResult The graphResult construct describes the detail of the topology of the end to end path through the network. It consists of three sections: settings - echoes the settings from the request body or the system settings as they apply to line styles, colours, weights and labels; hidden device types and groupings boxLabels - text labels for each of the groups graphData - a JSON construct containing a list of nodes and edges in the topological view of the path. Takes the form: { \"nodes\" : { ... }, \"edges\" : { ... } } where nodes contains data relating to the individual nodes in the graph. Each one is assigned a vDevice ID but there is recorded in each its hostname as label , it's position , its serial number in the sn field and the device type . Other key:value pairs relate to the inner workings of the IP Fabric graphing process. Example { \"vDevice/111111111\" : { \"boxId\" : \"SITE1\" , \"children\" : [], \"graphType\" : \"pathLookup\" , \"id\" : \"vDevice/111111111\" , \"label\" : \"HOSTNAME\" , \"parentPath\" : null , \"position\" : { \"x\" : 200 , \"y\" : 160 }, \"sn\" : \"SNXXXXXXXX\" , \"type\" : \"switch\" } edges contains data relating to the connections between the nodes along the data path. Each one is assigned an ID consisting of a combination of the node ID and interface at each end of the edge. The JSON construct also includes labels for the ends and the centre of the line, graphical details like (x,y) positions of the line and arrowheads and the colours and style of the lines. The severity_info key:value pair contains the information about how the edge conforms to applied intent checks; and the packet subtree contains a list of the layered packet headers in the simulation as it passes through the edge. Example { \"packet\" : [ { \"dst\" : \"dddd.dddd.dddd\" , \"etherType\" : \"ip\" , \"src\" : \"aaaa.aaaa.aaaa\" , \"type\" : \"ethernet\" , \"vlan\" : 10 }, { \"dst\" : [ \"10.10.20.112\" ], \"protocol\" : \"tcp\" , \"src\" : [ \"10.10.10.112\" ], \"type\" : \"ip\" }, { \"dst\" : [ \"80\" ], \"flags\" : [], \"src\" : [ \"10000\" ], \"type\" : \"tcp\" } ] } pathlookup The pathlookup construct describes the hop-by-hop forwarding and policy decisions that have been taken to get from source to destination. Notable key:value pairs within that construct include: eventSummary -- which highlights the success or failure of the path and the cause of any issues along the way. flags will show if any policy has caused the traffic to fail to reach the destination (e.g. acl-deny or zone-deny ) topics is a construct to represent the \"Result\" tab in the UI - it shows whether there have been ACL or firewall policies affecting the path, or any issues with forwarding behaviour. Positive values for the \"0\" key show that the decision has allowed traffic to pass; positive values for any of the other keys indicate a failure in the evaluation at some point decisions -- contains a record for each device in the path and the forwarding and policy decision it has to make in the path. For each device: trafficIn is a representation of the ingress interface and the edge that it is connected to trafficOut represents the egress interface and the edge that it sends traffic along towards the destination traces contains the data to represent how that decision was taken - for example that might include: a switching-nexthop decision in a switch will require a MAC address table match; an ip-routing decision in a router will require a routing table lookup and an ARP table; an ip-routing decision in a zone-based firewall will add in a security check to validate that policy allows the packet to pass; an mpls-switching decision will validate the VRF, MPLS labels and push/pop behaviour in the label stack; and so on. I've not given any specific examples here as they vary wildly depending on the specifics of your environment. There are also numerous additional fields in the pathlookup construct which will also be dependent on your particular path check. And there are some key:value pairs which have specific internal usage. But by using trial and error, you should be able to get a good handle on the behaviour of the path lookup using this guidance. From this note, you can see just how much thought and detail has gone into the development of the path lookup process. Hopefully it illustrates how closely IP Fabric models the behaviour of the data plane of network devices to give an accurate view of the impact of the network on forwarding behaviour.

All service logs; logs used internally by the IP Fabric system as well as a log of commands issued on every network device. Connectivity issues that had occurred during the retrieval of the snapshot. A network snapshot is a fully functional software copy of your network, including all configuration and state data. It enables to retrieve historical information, to follow network state changes, analyze connectivity issues, and more. Information about the network displayed in IP Fabric corresponds to the network snapshot selected in the Snapshot selector drop-down menu in the top left corner of the Main User Interface. New Snapshot To access the Snapshot Operations click the Discovery Snapshot menu entry (boxed in yellow). This will display all Loaded and Unloaded snapshots and allow the user to create new snapshots or perform operations against existing snapshots. A new snapshot can be taken at any time by clicking the New Snapshot button (boxed in red). After pressing the green Start discovery button, the system will then automatically start a new snapshot of the network with globally set parameters in the Settings menu entry. If you need to make some changes to the discovery process (add a new network seed, change login credentials, etc.) it needs to be done before a new snapshot is taken. This can either be adjusted globally or in the snapshot specific settings (boxed in blue). Snapshots can be run manually or on a schedule; for creating automatic snapshots follow the instructions located at Automatic Snapshots . Snapshot Specific Settings Adjusting the Settings for either a new snapshot or previously created snapshot will override the global settings. This is useful for example testing different SSH settings, Site Separation, Authentication methods. Inspection of Network Issues Initial snapshot of the network may not include all information about your network. This could be due to a variety of reasons including authorization or firewall issues; please take a look at Troubleshooting Discovery . Each successful or unsuccessful connection attempt is logged (see the following picture). Log for each device can be found in the Snapshot Connectivity Report (boxed in red). These logs are especially helpful when an error occurs. By examining them you can find the reason why the device wasn't correctly or fully discovered or what led to a connection failure. Modifying Snapshot Devices Adding Devices A new device can be added to an already existing snapshot by selecting the Add Devices button (boxed in red). You are then able to add a list of IP addresses or subnets to be tried in discovery and added to the current selected snapshot. This might be desirable if you performed almost a full snapshot of the network but only a few devices were not included or had connectivity issues that were resolved (for example wrong AAA configuration, firewall rules, forgot to include a network seed, etc). When adding a new device to an existing snapshot, the snapshot specific setting will be applied. If you need to change some settings (for example new network seed, login credentials, etc.) in order to add a new device to an existing snapshot, you need first to change settings for that particular snapshot and then add a new device. If Rediscover timed out devices check box is selected (boxed in blue) the discovery will try to rediscover any devices that previously timed out. To speed up the addition of new devices it is recommended to unselect this. If you would like to only rediscover devices this is also possible by not entering in any new device IP addresses and selecting the green Start Discovery . Finally, it is also possible to add new vendors (boxed in green) or enable previously disabled vendors (boxed in yellow) in the current selected snapshot. Please note that toggling a Vendor from on to off will not remove those devices from the snapshot. However, toggling all the Vendors to off will prevent IP Fabric from rediscovering those devices thus speeding up the addition of new devices similarly to disabling Rediscover timed out devices . Refresh Devices Using the Refresh Devices action will have the snapshot rediscover the selected devices and update the data models. You are able to manually select certain devices or in the example filter on a site and refresh all devices in a site. Please note changes in those devices might have affected other devices for instance if a routing change propagated throughout the network. A good example of using refresh device is for a Firewall change and ensuring the new rules are allowing or denying traffic in Path Lookup Simulations. Delete Devices Similarly to Refresh Devices the Delete Devices allows you to manually select certain devices for deletion in the snapshot. When devices are removed and were previously being displayed in Network Diagrams or Path Lookups, IP Fabric will then show a transit cloud indicating it does not have information about the next destination or connected device. Snapshot Actions Because of database maintenance, only up to 5 snapshots can be loaded into the memory. The default installation is to allow only 3 loaded snapshots but this can be changed by visiting Snapshot Settings Lock Snapshot By locking a snapshot, IP Fabric won\u2019t unload the selected snapshot automatically to the hard disk and it will keep it in the memory. The default installation is to allow only 1 locked snapshots but this can be changed by visiting Snapshot Settings Loaded Snapshots If the maximum number of loaded snapshot is 5 and 6th snapshot is created, the IP Fabric will automatically unload the oldest snapshot from the memory and save it to the hard drive. This can be done also manually on a selected snapshot by the Unload snapshot button. Unloaded Snapshots When a snapshot is unloaded, it's safely stored on your hard drive, but the data from a snapshot cannot be accessed directly through the IP Fabric user interface. To browse an unloaded snapshot, it needs to be loaded again to the memory by Load snapshot . Snapshot Retention It is important to note that there are Snapshot Retention rules in place that will delete snapshots after the hard drive reaches a certain threshold. For more information please visit IP Fabric Settings > Advanced > Snapshots and Schedule System Backup . Download Snapshots If needed, a selected snapshot can be downloaded directly from IP Fabric to your hard drive by the Download snapshot button. Clone Snapshot Loaded as well as unloaded snapshots can be cloned by the Clone snapshot button. This is handy in case you want to make some changes to the snapshot (adding a device etc.) but you want to keep the original file as a backup. Delete Snapshot Snapshots can be deleted by the Delete snapshot button. Load Snapshot from File This snapshot can be loaded back to the IP Fabric platform by a Load From File button.

Sites The site inventory provides an overview of discovered sites, the number of devices and users present at the site, and enables the generation of site-specific reports and diagrams. Sites are automatically calculated based on the administrative domain boundaries, such as carrier networks and other unmanaged infrastructure. A single, unmanaged traceroute hop is not considered a site boundary, so unmanaged infrastructure is reconstructed from the probes. The specific method of site boundary calculation can be changed in the settings. An unknown site is either a collection of isolated devices or when a device forms a single-device site. Devices The device inventory represents all logical managed network infrastructure devices that have been discovered and analyzed. Each entry provides the following information: Site is the logical grouping to which device belongs to, while single-site or isolated devices belong to an unknown site. Routing domain is an IP Fabric generated separation based upon the contiguous layer 3 routing domain to which the device belongs to. Switching domain is an IP Fabric generated separation based upon contiguous layer 2 switching domain the device belongs to. Hostname is the short name of the device. Serial Number is the serial number of the device (API column name is snHw ).

Network Or Site View Tables display data for the whole network by default. To only display data for a specific site, select \"site\" from the drop down menu on the top left. Table Filtering Simple or advanced filters can be applied to each table. By default, filtering is available above each column, and accepted filtering values can be strings, numbers, IP addresses, networks, boolean values, or select box values. RegEx can be used in a string filter by adding =~ after the expression. An exact match of the value can be achieved by adding = before the expression Fields containing IP Addresses can be filtered by entering the IP/prefix length in the CIDR notation. For example, 10.0.0.0/25 will find addresses between and including 10.0.0.128 and 10.0.0.255 . Advanced filters can be used to construct arbitrary complex expressions by combining nested filters and filter groups with any number of logical AND and OR operators between them. Advanced filters can be saved and recalled for each specific table. Filters are stored per table and are available to all users. Table Exports Table outputs can be exported into CSV format for further processing and the text can be opened by any spreadsheet processor.

Verifying The Network You can verify a lot of technologies and configuration parts with IP Fabric. You can simply go through technologies in IP Fabric menu (for example MAC table): or quickly find particular technology you are interested in using search (for example MAC table): Today's goal is to check all port channels in our network. Step 1 \u2013 Find The Proper Technology Table As described above we can simply browse IP Fabric menu and find a particular technology table but in our case as we know exactly what we are looking for, search menu will be a better choice. In the upper right corner click to search field and type your request. We are looking for port channels, ether channels or just link aggregation. Because I'm from Cisco world I would type in port channel . Search returns more results because there are more technology tables with port channels. We are interested in the last one in this case Link Aggregation (LAG)/Portchannel/Etherchannel Member status table . Just click on it and we are there. Step 2 \u2013 Look For Malfunctions For your convenience IP Fabric has predefined a lot of rules and reports. In our particular case port channels are colored green if everything is OK and other color is used when some malfunction is in place. You can easily sort the table by clicking the desired field in the header. In the example below we clicked on Members (Status) . We can instantly see that some port channels have interface down (blue color) or individual port (yellow color). You can also filter colors by clicking them above in Reports box. When clicked small eye icon is displayed and items are filtered only to the selected color. Click again to the same color to clear filter. Customize Predefined Rules Predefined coloring rules can be fully customized. To do that click on predefined rule name in Reports box above the technology table which is Port-channel members state in our case. Now you can check and change predefined colorization rules. Let's change coloring from blue to red when port in port-channel is down: Remove rules from blue color. Click on blue color and then trash icon: Click to red color and Add rule . Select logical OR because we want mark member red if any of defined rules apply. We are interested in Members (Status) table row. We would like to check if this row contains specific string. Specify string we are looking for like (D) or (DOWN) Click Preview to see if you rule works If you are satisfied with the result click Update rule . You can also add new set of coloring rules. For example, you want to check used aggregation protocol. Please check Intent Verification Rules section. Step 3 \u2013 Fix It In step 2 we found few malfunctioned port channels. You can gather more information in IP Fabric like check network diagrams or directly connect to device with problematic port channel. Click on device host name. You can go to network diagram (click to switching domain number). You can connect to device. Step 4 \u2013 An Overall Overview Dashboard is the right place where you can see the overall status of your network. There are predefined widgets for user convenience but you can also add, remove or edit it. For our example with port channels you can go to Dashboard , widget Neighborship compliance and there is report called Port Channel members states. By clicking selected color you are redirected to technology table with color filter applied. Adding Custom Report To The Dashboard First let's create new coloring rule which will be then added to the Dashboard. Go to Technology \u2192 Port Channels \u2192 Member status table . Click to Intent Verification Rules button in the right toolbox menu. Specify Rule name , for example Check protocol . Select Colorized column , it's Protocol in our case. Leave Widgets empty for now. Click on blue . Create rule Protocol insensitive equal lacp Click on yellow . Create rule Protocol equal static . Click Create rule . We crated new coloring rule but we would like to see status of port channel protocol on the Dashboard. We can add it like this: Go to Dashboard . Click Edit in the upper right corner. Click +Add row . Choose row style what you would like to add. Click on Untitled and enter some name for example Port channels . Click +Add Widget . Select widget type in our case it's Intent Verifications . Name widget for example Port channels . Look for Table color rules and add it to Widget.

Interface State The Half-Duplex table presents interfaces in the Half-Duplex mode. Most network equipment supports and prefers the full duplex setting. There are some exceptions when half duplex operation is necessary, and in such a cases all sides must be consistently set for half-duplex operations. The ErrDisabled table presents information about interfaces disabled due to violations of operational parameters.

Also your source network device and its interface can be selected when choosing User defined First Hop Algorithm. Source/Destination IP Address and Port As a source/destination IP address can be used a plain IP address or a CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) when for example simulating path lookup from a host to a network. By default, ICMP protocol and Echo request is chosen for path lookup. When switched to Web HTTP/HTTPS, TCP destination port 80 and 443 with (web|http|https) application is set by default. When extending details, transport protocol and range of ports can be specified for a source and for a destination. When more destination ports are specified, IP Fabric will analyze all of them individually during the pathlookup. Port can be changed to an arbitrary one for TCP/UDP protocols. The following flags can be also set for TCP traffic \u2013 None/ACK/FIN/SYN/RST/PSH/URG. TTL and Fragment Offset In More details , TTL (Time to live ) and Fragment offset can be set - thus affecting path lookup output - default TTL is 128 and Fragment offset is set to 0 Application When evaluating security rules and security appliances on the path check traffic on L7, an application can be checked on the path lookup.

Most of the tables display live snapshot data generated by graph algorithms without preexisting cache. The first load of a table usually takes longer than subsequent loads, but all tables were built to handle a large capacity and complex queries, so the outcome should be better than analyzing the output in an external application like Excel. Working with tables The ARP technology table is used as an example below to demonstrate the functionality of tables. Table Description You can get a short description of the current table along with API examples via question mark button. Export to CSV The current table view can be exported to CSV. This is useful for additional data processing in an external application. Contextual Help Contextual help (tooltip) is displayed when a mouse cursor hovers over a table icon or table header text. Searching for Data When using filters this will change what is displayed in the table, the exported CSV data, and the API documentation found in the Table Description . Simple Filtering Type in what you are looking for in most columns. The example above shows a search for all devices with an IP address starting \"10.41.133\" throughout all the ARP tables in our infrastructure. Use the below button to clear the search results. Advanced Filtering If you need a more precise filter use Advanced Filter . Filters are defined by groups and rules. Each group can contain on or more rules or another group. There is always one root group which cannot be deleted (number 1). Select the logical operator for each group. The example above shows logical Or for the first group and logical And for groups two and three. What does example above do? It shows all devices with hostname L47AC8 AND interface Et7/2 as well as devices with hostname L43SD73 AND interface Et13/0 . In other words: \"Show me all devices with hostname L47AC8 which have interface Et7/2 , plus all devices with hostname L43SD73 with interface Et13/0 . Share Table View The table view can be shared with other users. Intent Verification Rules (Colorizing Columns) The table column can be colored based on predefined rules. Existing (as well as default rules) are visible above table and can be edited or removed. To create a new rule, you need to specify Rule name and select the Colorized column . Adding the rule to a Dashboard Widget will enable it to be displayed in the Dashboard, but is not required (check Dashboard documentation for more details). Finally, specify a filter rule to colorize the selected column: Choose the color to apply rules to. Add rules based on the same logic as described in Advanced Filtering . A color can be designated as a Default color which means that it will be used if it does not match any other rules. Click Update rule or Create rule to save your changes. In the example above, all items in the VRF column which are named vrf4 will be colored red. A summary number of items which matches this rule will also be displayed on Dashboard in the Interfaces widget. Display setting Select what columns are displayed by choosing in Display settings . This will also change the behavior of the CSV output and the API documentation in the Table Description . Enable Sticky first column to fix the first column in case of horizontal scrolling. Enable Sticky table header to fix the table header in case of vertical scrolling. Tables' rows and text can be adjusted to small, medium or large sizes with Rows height adjust .

When one of those events is triggered, we'll send an HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. Webhooks can be used to send notifications to messaging tools of your choice or update an external issue tracker. You're only limited by your imagination. To setup a webhook, please navigate to Settings / Webhooks Events Whenever IP Fabric generates an event, we check the list of active webhooks and determine, which of them (if any) are subscribed to the event that has just occurred. Then we send the webhook payload to corresponding URLs. The receiving party should confirm the payload with HTTP Status 2xx in response and can process the payload as needed. In case the receiving party doesn\u2019t confirm the payload (because it is not reachable, it returns a bad status code, or the delivery times out), we retry delivering the webhook payload again in 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes since the initial delivery. In case we cannot deliver the webhook in these five attempts, we give up. All delivery attempts are recorded in the webhook delivery history (in the webhook edit view). Payload Hash Since the webhook payload might be delivered over untrusted networks, each webhook message is accompanied by a SHA256 HMAC payload hash signature. You configure the HMAC secret when configuring the webhook in UI. To validate the webhook payload (i.e. to make sure the webhook payload is sent from IP Fabric platform and was not altered in transit), calculate the hash signature of the raw webhook payload on the receiving end (with the same password), and compare it with the hash calculated by the server (sent in X-IPF-Signature HTTP header of the webhook message). // JavaScript validation code const hmac = createHmac ( \"sha256\" , secret ); hmac . update ( bodyString ); const verified = hmac . digest ( \"hex\" ) === request . headers [ \"x-ipf-signature\" ]; To test your webhook (even an inactive one), use the Test button in UI.

It may be necessary to increase this timeout. Maximum Number Of Parallel Sessions To prevent flooding your network with too many SSH/TELNET sessions set Maximum number of parallel sessions . This setting can be also helpful if the AAA server (TACACS/Radius) has a limit of parallel AAA requests for users. In rare cases, the Cisco ISE or similar systems may rate limit the command authorization. When there are too many authorization failures and Cisco ISE is in place, try to limit the number of parallel sessions down to 10 and steadily increase. Basic Failure How many times to retry a connection for any error, except authentication failure. Authentication Failure Authentication failure can occur even if a user is authorized to Login. For example, this may happen when an AAA server is overloaded or an authentication packet is lost.

IP Fabric uses an SSH tunnel established by python on the client and the server side. We successfully tested IP Fabric against jumphosts with the following python versions: Python version on the jumphost 2.7 tested 3.4 tested 3.5 tested 3.6 supported 3.7 supported 3.8 supported 3.9 supported 3.10 tested tested \u2013 jumphost was successfully tested, but it is not officially supported by the underlying SSH tunnel project supported \u2013 jumphost was successfully tested, and it is officially supported by the underlying SSH tunnel project We strongly recommend using python 3.6-3.9 on the jumphost side as it is officially supported by the underlying SSH tunnel tool project. Warning Please bear in mind, that once the connection is established, it will be enabled permanently, until disabled or removed! If there are any network issues, IP Fabric software will try to establish a connection periodically. Important In Discovery Seed, at least one IP address behind the Jumphost has to be provided as a starting point. Adding New Jumphost Open jumphost settings, using item Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 SSH/TELNET At the bottom of the page, please select + Add button Fill in all necessary data Label - the name for configuration (mandatory) Jump host Address - IP address of FQDN name (mandatory) IPv4 subnets - subnet in CIDR representation, allows adding more than open, separated with spaces (mandatory) Warning If you use 0.0.0.0/0 or another subnet that includes the IP address of IP Fabric , please make sure to add IP Fabric IP address/subnet to \"Exclude IPv4 subnet\" . Otherwise, the connection to IP Fabric will be lost and you will not be able to access IP Fabric GUI/CLI and it will require manual intervention to fix. Exclude IPv4 subnets - subnet to exclude in CIDR representation, allows to add more than open, separated with spaces (optional) Login type Use credentials - required to provide username and password Use SSH keys - if you copied the ssh public key to the proxy server, it won\u2019t require providing a password (please jump to the SSH key configuration section) Username - Username for authentication (mandatory) Password - password for authentication (mandatory if \u2018Use credentials\u2019 is used) i.e., refer to the picture below.

Please follow official documentation at https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized-key Restart sshd service to apply settings If the key has been copied you can use the option \u2018Use SSH keys' instead of 'Use credentials\u2019 Disabling Jumphost Connection Edit configuration that needs to be disabled, i.e.\\ Change the setting to Disabled , Click the Update button Remove Jumphost Configuration On the Jumphost servers list, select the server you want to remove Click Delete button Jumphost Known Issues Non-TCP Discovery Only TCP connections work through the jumphost. Traceroute with ICMP is not supported so the discovery process might not be able to get over the unreachable parts of the network (for example sites separated by the provider\u2019s network). Because of this, you will have to add at least one IP address of a network device from each site to the Discovery seeds settings. IP Fabric Is Not Accessible After Saving Jumphost Configuration If you can't open the main GUI or SSH to the IP Fabric machine, the subnet/IP address of the IP Fabric machine was most likely included in the jumphost configuration. To fix this issue, you have to have a direct access to the virtual machine CLI from a hypervisor, the password for osadmin user account, and do the following: Login with osadmin account to the virtual machine CLI Filter out the jumphost services with systemctl | grep jumphost command. Each configured jumphost has its own ID. Stop the jumphost service with the command sudo systemctl stop jumphost@xxxx.service , confirm the osadmin password Check that the jumphost process is inactive with systemctl status jumphost@xxxx.service command IP Fabric GUI should be accessible by now. Login into the IP Fabric main GUI with your regular account and go to Settings \u2192 Advanced \u2192 SSH/Telnet . Make a screenshot or copy the settings of the old jumphost and then delete or edit the jumphost settings. Put IP address/subnet of the IP Fabric machine to the exclude IPv4 subnets or edit the IPv4 subnets so it does not contain the IP address of IP Fabric . Info If IP Fabric becomes inaccessible via GUI or SSH again, repeat the previous steps and again edit the jumphost configuration. Custom SSH/Telnet Ports Info Custom SSH/Telnet ports settings enable the discovery process to use different ports for connecting. The standard for SSH is port 22 and 23 for Telnet. In the following example we configure the discovery process to use port 8080 for SSH connections to 192.168.168.10 : As a result of such configuration, we would create a new item under the Custom SSH/Telnet ports configuration, which will be applied to every new snapshot created by IP Fabric.

Each task consists of 1 or more operational commands (CLI or API). You can find the list of all Discovery Tasks in the Feature matrix . Some fundamental TASKS are critical for discovery and topology calculations (Neighbors, ARP, Mac, RIB, etc.). The Discovery Tasks settings are introduced in version 3.7.0. Since then, the user can manipulate specific tasks for the discovery process to avoid extra data collection (when particular protocols are not present on the network) or avoid specific operational commands to be executed on specific hardware platforms. Warning Disabling TASKS will reduce the level of information collected by IP Fabric. If some fundamental TASKS are disabled, it can affect the topology or Path Lookup results. By default, there are three main Discovery Task rules in the platform: Rule Name Rule Description Disable Pagination By default disabled for F5 devices - command is modifying the configuration and can break cluster synchronization. Transceivers By default disabled for all vendors - certain Cisco platforms may be affected by a memory leak bug and lead to device crash or hung VTY line. More at Known Issues > Cisco NTP By default disabled for Cisco Firepower - on some versions a Firepower bug may freeze the CLI session In the following example, we are creating a rule to disable OSPFv3 on Juniper EX.

This means that snapshots marked as retained by a keep rule can be deleted when the HDD utilization or number of snapshots are exceeded.

Be aware that the dashboard can redirect communication to a different URL Login IP For Cisco Meraki For the CLI (SSH/Telnet) discovery, the Login IP represents the IP address that platform uses to discover the device. IP Fabric discovers Cisco Meraki via API, and therefore different logic described below is used to assign Login IP parameter for Meraki devices in the main inventory.

Disable LDAP Authentication Remove all LDAP configuration domains in Settings \u2192 User Management \u2192 LDAP Settings to disable LDAP authentication. Local vs LDAP Authentication By default, local authentication (or in other words information stored in the local database) is the preferred authentication method, where LDAP is used as a backup authentication method. If a user is not found in the local database and LDAP authentication is defined, IP Fabric will redirect the authentication attempt to an LDAP server. If a user is successfully authenticated through LDAP, basic information about this user is then passed from LDAP and stored in the local database. Troubleshooting Before contacting our support, please make sure that inputs entered into IP Fabric user interface are correct. This can be done using ldapsearch command utility: ldapsearch is present in IP Fabric image (access it via ssh) or it can be installed locally as part of ldap-utils Linux package.

This upgrade requires IP Fabric to be on v4.4.3 prior to upgrading to v5.0.0 . API Versioning API versioning has been introduced in v5.0.0. API endpoint URLs will now contain api/v5.0 rather than api/v1 . If you are scripting against the API or using it to integrate into other systems, you must change the URL to the new format. For more information on this please visit the API Documentation page. ipfabric and ipfabric-diagrams Python SDK's have been updated to support the new changes. Please visit python-ipfabric and python-ipfabric-diagrams for more information. SSO and API versioning Upgrade to v5.0.0 will break custom SSO integrations an will require changes to your files prior to re-enabling. Before upgrading and if you have SSO deployed please contact your Solution Architect to copy your custom settings and and re-deploy them after the update. Input validation String input validation has been improved in features such as FTP/SFTP backup, Jumphost, SNMP, and certificate settings and will only accept the following characters: A-Za-z0-9.,/-_@%^:=+ - . Previously set strings may no longer work. For example, an SNMP community string previously set with an invalid character (i.e. IPFabric&123 ) would cause SNMP queries not to work until the string is updated with only valid characters RBAC phase 1 The first phase of a new implementation of Role-Based Access Control is included in 5.0.0 . There is a known caveat where generation of API tokens does not take into account the new RBAC roles \u2013 this will be remedied in 5.0.0 . If you are planning on using Roles and API Tokens it is recommended to wait for the fix before assigning any user to the custom roles. If a user is in a custom Role they will not be able to create an API token until the next patch release. Extreme Family Rename Extreme XOS family has been correctly renamed to EXOS . IPv6 Support IPv6 support has been significantly enhanced in 5.0.0 with new tables and a new underlying network model. As a result, IPv6 data in older snapshots may not display correctly in 5.0.0 . We have made all efforts possible to migrate data between versions, but if you do have issues in 5.0.0 , please run a new snapshot and check the data again. Please raise a support ticket if you still experience problems. Path Lookup API Change A new required parameter enableRegions has been added to the Path Lookup API for Unicast and Multicast. If set to false it will ignore the values in the srcRegions and dstRegions parameters. enableRegions [mandatory] - boolean - (default false) UPGRADE NOTICES This upgrade requires IP Fabric to be on v4.4.3 prior to upgrade to v5.0.0 . IP Fabric v4.4.2 or lower will not work -\u2013 please upgrade to 4.4.3 using the normal method before carrying out the 5.0.0 upgrade process. Due to the major changes stated above, automatic updates will be disabled for this release and will require manual upgrade. Prior to update please ensure you perform a backup of your system or it is highly recommend to create a VM snapshot It is recommended (for all updates) to unload all snapshots prior to performing the upgrade. Requires 10GB of free disk space. Estimated upgrade time is around 20 minutes however depending on the resources of your VM it could take longer than an hour. During update to 5.0.0 no message about the update being finished is shown and a refresh of the Admin page is required to check if the API and services are back online. After approximately 5-10 minutes after the update file has finished uploading to the server you should be able to log into the IPF CLI as osadmin and run the following command to track installation progress tail -f /var/log/nimpee/dist_upgrade.log If tail command is not found wait a few minutes and log out and back into the CLI. Once upgrade has finished the system will reboot (see below the example output of the dist_upgrade.log file). After all updates please Clear Browser Cache . Not all new features will be available until a new snapshot is created on the updated version. If after the upgrade you experience issues with AQL: internal error , Dashboards, or Topology please first try restarting the ArangoDB service from the System Administrator page prior to contacting support. Log into the System Administrator Page located or port 443 In the System Status page under System Services you will find ArangoDB Next to the status color is a restart button which will restart the service If you run into any other issues during or after the upgrade please open a support ticket .

The most significant change is that Users are now assigned to a Role(s) and not given specific permissions. During the upgrade process your users will be migrated to the appropriate roles. For more information see the documentation at the links below. Policies This is where you define the endpoints users have access to. There are 5 built-in Policies in v5.0.0 settings : Access to snapshot and product settings endpoints discovery : Access to discovery endpoints team : Access to user management endpoints tables : Access to table endpoints others : Migrated read scope - to be deprecated in 5.1 Roles A Role can consist of one or more policies admin role cannot be changed or deleted Users A User can also consist of one or more roles IP Fabric VM OS-Level Changes The OS has been updated to Debian 11 \"bullseye\" openvpn version has been updated to 2.5.1 This version drops older ciphers, and could have an impact on users utilizing those ciphers sshuttle version has been updated to 1.0.5 This upgrade could potentially impact jumphost connectivity removed jailkit for osadmin user There is still the limitation for changing the osadmin account password only via running nimpee-net-config -t CLI users logging in as osadmin now have sudo access Warning Any action on the CLI as a root and/or autoboss user may severely damage the product and/or the system itself. Such actions taken without direct communication with the IP Fabric Support or Solution Architect teams can render the system unusable. Boot Wizard Changes For VM initial deployments where console access is not possible, it's now possible to run the boot wizard via SSH Boot the VM, determine the IP address assigned to it from DHCP, and SSH to the VM: ssh osadmin@<dhcp-learned-ip-address> Once logged in, run nimpee-net-config -a cloud-init preliminary support For users wanting to automate VM installations, cloud-init can be used for initial VM provisioning IP address assignment to the VM is supported via cloud-init Any other changes via cloud-init (users, ssh keys, resizing) may work, but are untested and unsupported Changing the password for osadmin through cloud-init is discouraged as it has some implications, use nimpee-net-config -t instead If you are using auto cloud-init via certain cloud providers, note the OpenSSH server will regenerate new public/private keys Added qemu-guest-agent for easier monitoring in environments such as OpenStack Entry input validation has been improved in features such as backup, jumphosts, SNMP and certificates Strings should only accept the following characters: A-Za-z0-9.,/-_@%^:=+ - Previously set strings may no longer work.
