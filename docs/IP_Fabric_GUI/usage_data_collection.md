# Usage Data Collection

IP Fabric collects usage data to help improve the product. We use
[PostHog](https://posthog.com) as a client-side event library.

We collect only anonymous data not bound to any personal information like names, emails, etc.
The data describe the user environment (browser, operating system, window size, etc.) and user interactions with the
application (clicks, page views, etc.).

The data are collected locally on your IP Fabric instance. Usage data will be
included in the Techsupport file unless you opt out when selecting what to include
in the Techsupport file.
