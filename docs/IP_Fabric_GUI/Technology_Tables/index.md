# Overview

Tables enable analysis and correlation of network state information and
parameters on the fly. Most of the tables display live snapshot data
generated by graph algorithms without a preexisting cache. The first
load of a large table usually takes longer than subsequent loads,
however all tables were built to handle large capacities and complex
queries, so the outcome is likely to be better than analyzing the output
in external applications like Excel.

## Network or Site view

Tables display data for the whole network by default. To only display
data for a specific site, select "site" from the drop down menu on the
top left.

## Table filtering

Simple or advanced filters can be applied to each table. By default,
filtering is available above each column, and accepted filtering values
can be strings, numbers, IP addresses, networks, boolean values, or
selectbox values.

RegEx can be used in a string filter by adding `=~` **after** the
expression. An exact match of the value can be achieved by adding `=`
**before** the expression

Fields containing IP Addresses can be filtered by entering the IP/prefix
length in the CIDR notation. For example, `10.0.0.0/25` will find
addresses between and including `10.0.0.128` and `10.0.0.255`.

Advanced filters can be used to construct arbitrary complex expressions
by combining nested filters and filter groups with any number of logical
AND and OR operators between them. Advanced filters can be saved and
recalled for each specific table. Filters are stored per table and are
available to all users.

## Table Exports

Table outputs can be exported into CSV format for further processing and
the text can be opened by any spreadsheet processor. In some cases,
Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets convert strings from the CSV
files into dates, but these can remain as exact values by renaming the
content to `"string"` to force the spreadsheet to retain the original
content.

!!! note
    It may take several seconds to prepare an export of large tables.

## Tooltips

Each table contains built in help with the table description by clicking on the
question mark ![tooltip](tooltip.png). Hover the mouse over the column name for
a description of column content.

## Column visibility

Tables can be especially large to facilitate easier information
correlation, however not all columns need to always be visible. To hide
or show individual columns, click the ![visibility](visibility.png)
(toggle column visibility) button and select which the columns to be
displayed. The first column can be set as "sticky" to facilitate
analysis of tables with many columns. Row height can be adjusted by
selecting small, medium or large font.

## Persistent table view

To improve usability, each table remembers the settings and filtering for each
user. To reset a table to it’s original state, click
the ![restore](restore.png) (restore table settings) button on the right hand
side of the column header.
