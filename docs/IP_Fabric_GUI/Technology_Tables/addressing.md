# Addressing

The Addressing section provides information about every IP address on
every managed network infrastructure device.

IP addresses should be unique throughout the network, except for highly
specialized applications like geographical service distribution via
anycast. Duplicate IPs usually signify a network fault, such as loss of
a keep alive link or misconfiguration, and actively managed duplicate IP
addresses are listed in a separate table.
