# Networks

The Network section presents detailed information about the Layer 3
network state and routing convergence.

A network connected to any of the managed devices on the site is
considered to be a managed network. Users represent the number of
non-network ARP entries observed on the network routers and gateways
present IP address of the corresponding managed device or devices. Both
primary and secondary addresses are considered as gateways. Virtual
gateways present the IP addresses of the First Hop Redundancy Protocol
groups that are active in the network.

Each contiguous routing topology is considered to be a routing domain.
Diagrams are presented for each routing domain in addition to a complete
routing table comprised of all of the routing tables discovered in the
network.
