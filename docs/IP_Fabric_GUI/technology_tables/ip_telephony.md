# IP Telephony

## Overview

The **IP Telephony** section provides information about all IP phones (VoIP)
and their clients detected on the network. Phone information is
extracted using a link layer discovery protocol or MAC address.

## Phones

The `IP Phones and connected devices` table details network information of every discovered IP phone and
its connected hosts.

`Phone IP` is the IP address of the phone.

`Name` is the short name of the phone.

`Phone MAC` is the MAC address of the phone.

`Vendor` is the vendor of the NIC based on OUI lookup in the IEEE database.

`Phone Int.` is the network interface name of the phone.

`User IP` is the IP address of a host connected to the phone.

`User MAC` is the MAC address of a host connected to the phone. In cases where there is
more than one host connected to the phone, a "multiple" message is
displayed instead of the individual MAC addresses.
