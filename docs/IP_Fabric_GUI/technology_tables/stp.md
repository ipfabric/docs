# Spanning Tree

The Spanning Tree protocol prevents loops and manages redundancy in a
layer 2 network. Spanning tree instances and contiguous domains are
analyzed for stability and consistency.

For each spanning tree instance, a number of parameters are presented,
such as virtual ports present, root bridge and its priorities, instance
diagrams, number of users, and instance convergence rate.

Spanning tree details range from the spanning tree domain, which is
contiguously interconnected to spanning tree instances, through to
individual spanning tree ports.
