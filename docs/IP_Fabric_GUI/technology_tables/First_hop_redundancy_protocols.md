# First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRP)

The **FHRP** (First Hop Redundancy Protocols) section covers state analysis of HSRP and VRRP protocols. Redundancy protocols are not fully state-aware due to a limited two-way handshake, resulting in undesired active/active or down/standby scenarios when unidirectional links are present and traffic black-holing.
