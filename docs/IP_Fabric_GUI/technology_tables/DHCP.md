# DHCP

The **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) section provides information for configuring both **DHCP server** and **DHCP relay**.

DHCP information for IPv6 is not supported yet.

## DHCP Server

The **Summary** tab gives you basic information about DHCP server configuration across all devices where this functionality is configured.

Every server is also linked to its **pool**. Pools can be accessed in the **Pools** tab.

The **Leases**, **Excluded Ranges**, and **Interfaces** tabs provide different views of DHCP information with some more details.

## DHCP Relay

The **Interfaces** tab provides information about the configuration of DHCP Relay per interface. Option 82 configuration information is also available.

The **Interfaces stats** tab provides detailed status information per interface.

The **Global Stats** tab provides the same statistics as **Interfaces stats** but globally, per device.
