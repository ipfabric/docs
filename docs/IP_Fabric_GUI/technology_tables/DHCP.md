# DHCP

This section provides information for configuring both **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) **server** and **relay**.

DHCP information for IPv6 is not supported yet.

## DHCP Server

The **Summary** tab gives you basic information about DHCP server configuration across all devices where this functionality is configured.

Every server is also linked to its **pool**. Pools can be accessed in the next tab.

**Leases, Excluded Ranges and Interfaces** provide a different view on DHCP information with some more details.

## DHCP Relay

The **Interfaces** tab provides information about configuration of DHCP Relay per interface. Option 82 configuration information is also available.

The **Interfaces stats** tab provides detailed status information per interface.

The **Global stats** tab provides same statistics as **interfaces stats** but globally, per device.
