# Overview

The **Technology** tables enable the analysis and correlation of network state information and
parameters on the fly. Most of the tables display live snapshot data
generated by graph algorithms without a pre-existing cache. The first
load of a large table usually takes longer than subsequent loads;
however, all tables were built to handle large capacities and complex
queries, so the outcome is likely to be better than analyzing the output
in external applications like Excel.

## Network or Site View

Tables display data for the whole network by default. To only display
data for a specific site, select "site" from the drop-down menu on the
top left.

## Table Filtering

Simple or advanced filters can be applied to each table. By default,
filtering is available above each column, and accepted filtering values
can be strings, numbers, IP addresses, networks, Boolean values, or
select box values.

### RegEx Simple Column Filter Examples

- `=~(cis|ari)` -- RegEx matches also `cisco` or `arista` values (not exact match).
- `=~^(cisco|arista)$` -- RegEx matches `cisco` or `arista` values only (exact match).
- `=cisco` -- Matches only `cisco` values (exact match).
- `cis` -- Matches `cis` or `cisco` (prefix match).
- `=~^(?!cisco)` -- RegEx negative lookahead -- matches all except values starting with `cisco`.

Some columns containing IP addresses (such as `Login IPv4` or `Login IPv6` within **Inventory -->
Devices**) can be filtered by entering the IP/prefix length in CIDR notation.
For example, `10.0.0.0/25` will find addresses between and including
`10.0.0.128` and `10.0.0.255`.

### Additional Operators for Routing Columns

Columns containing IPv4 prefixes (such as `Route` within **Technology -->
Routing --> Routes**) have:

- an additional operator "contains IP address" (API: `ip`, UI: `IP:`)

  !!! example

      `IP:192.168.127.129` will match any prefix containing that IP address,
      such as `192.168.127.0/24` or `192.168.0.0/16`, but not
      `192.168.128.0/24`.

- as well as a set of CIDR operators:
  - is strict supernet (API: `gt`, UI: `>`)
  - is supernet (API: `gte`, UI: `>=`)
  - is strict subnet (API: `lt`, UI: `<`)
  - is subnet (API: `lte`, UI: `<=`)
  - overlaps (API: `sect`, UI: `@`)
  - does not overlap (API: `nsect`, UI: `!@`)

### Advanced Filters

Advanced filters can be used to construct arbitrarily complex expressions
by combining nested filters and filter groups with any number of logical
`AND` and `OR` operators between them. Advanced filters can be saved and
recalled for each specific table. Filters are stored per table and are
available to all users.

#### Device-based advanced filters

![Device Filters](table_device_filters.png){ width=250 .center }

Supported device properties:

- Vendor
- Family
- Model
- Platform
- Version
- Image
- Type
- Login Ip
- Domain
- Uptime
- API Slug
- Attributes (via an attribute name)

These filters are available in **most—though not all—tables**. Certain tables, such as **Site Summary tables**, do not support device-based property filtering.  
For detailed information, consult the **`Rapidoc`** documentation specific to your chosen table.

#### Accessing `Rapidoc`  
To navigate to `Rapidoc`, follow these steps:  

1. **Open the target table:** Navigate to any table where you want to use **Device-based advanced filters**. Click the `...` menu to access **Table Description**.  
   ![Table Description](index_advanced_filtering/Navigate_to_table_desc.png){ width="500" .center } 
2. **Access API documentation:** Scroll down and select **API Documentation**.  
   ![API Documentation](index_advanced_filtering/navigate_to_rapidoc.png){ width="500" .center } 
3. **Review applicable filters:** Switch to the **Schema** tab to view all available filters for the selected table.  
   ![Schema](index_advanced_filtering/switch_to_schema.png){ width="500" .center } 

!!! note  
    For tables displaying a **local device** connected to a **neighbor device**, filtering is **only supported for the local device**.  

## Table Exports

Table outputs can be exported into CSV format for further processing, and
the text can be opened by any spreadsheet processor. In some cases,
Microsoft Excel and Google Spreadsheets convert strings from the CSV
files into dates, but these can remain as exact values by renaming the
content to `string` to force the spreadsheet to retain the original
content.

!!! note

    It may take several seconds to prepare an export of large tables.

## Tooltips

Each table contains built-in help in `Table description` under the `...` menu
(in the top-right corner of the table):

![Table description](table_description_option.png){ .center }

Hover the mouse cursor over a column header for the column's description:

![On-hover tooltip](table_onhover.png){ .center }

## Column Visibility

Tables can be especially large to facilitate easier information correlation;
however, not all columns need to always be visible.

Select `Display settings` under the `...` menu and choose which columns to show
or hide:

![Display settings](table_display_settings_option.png){ .center }

## Column Size

Use the `Auto size` toggle to either automatically size columns to fit their
current content (when enabled) or let columns remember user-defined widths
(when disabled):

![Auto size](table_auto_size.png){ .center }

## Persistent Table View

To improve usability, each table remembers the settings and filtering for each
user.

To reset a table to its original state, select `Restore table settings` under
the `...` menu:

![Restore table settings](table_restore.png){ .center }

## Regular Expression Syntax
Regular expressions are evaluated in PostgreSQL using POSIX standard with some extensions. Detailed information can be found in [Regular Expression Details](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP:~:text=9.7.3.1.%C2%A0Regular%20Expression%20Details) section of PostgreSQL documentation.

For a quick introduction to regular expressions, refer to [Regular Expressions Quick Start](https://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html) guide on [Regular-Expressions.info](https://www.regular-expressions.info/).

!!! note "Literal Backlashes Require Different Amounts of Escaping Depending on the Context"

    - `\` in bind variables (Table view mode) in the web UI (automatically escaped to `\\` unless the value is wrapped in double quotes and already escaped properly).
    - `\\` in bind variables (JSON view mode) and queries in the web UI.

## Create Links to Table Views

![Share URL options for tables](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/table_share_url_options.png){ .center }

To point to a particular dataset, the link may include
[a snapshot ID that IP Fabric will switch to](../discovery_snapshot.md#create-url-pointing-to-specific-snapshot) after opening.

Also, you can generate the link in two forms:

1. A short form, like
   `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/devices?copyId=916264918z`, is
   useful for sharing.
2. A long URL that contains the filter definition in JSON format:
   `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/devices?options=%7B"filters"%3A%7B"and"%3A%5B%7B"hostname"%3A%5B"like"%2C"L7"%5D%7D%2C%7B"or"%3A%5B%7B"vendor"%3A%5B"eq"%2C"cisco"%5D%7D%2C%7B"vendor"%3A%5B"eq"%2C"fortinet"%5D%7D%5D%7D%5D%7D%7D`.
   - These URLs can be used, for example, to generate templates for your
     automations. You can prepare the structure of a filter using the **Advanced
     Filter** GUI, then replace values with variables in your automation
     scripts.

## Pin Pages to the Main Menu for Quick Access

### Pin a Page to the Main Menu

To pin any page in the Technology Tables, click the pin button next to the table name. The page will instantly appear in the left Main Menu.

![Pin a page](page_pin.png){ width="250" .center }

### Unpin a Page from the Main Menu

If you no longer want it in the Menu, you can unpin it by clicking the pin in the Main Menu or by clicking the pin next to the page title again.

![Unpin a page](page_unpin.png){ width="250" .center }
