# Endpoints

Public and private cloud APIs provide information about virtual machines. Previously, IP Fabric was unable to collect information about virtual machines. However, starting from version `4.4`, IP Fabric displays information about virtual machines discovered through these APIs. 

Each vendor provides a different scope of information for VMs, so IP Fabric may not be able to retrieve all the necessary data for end-host calculations (such as ARP or MAC address tables).

The **Endpoints** section provides detailed information about cloud virtual machines, including their hostnames, sites, VM names, status, OS version, number of interfaces, and interface details (e.g., IP address, MAC address, etc.).
