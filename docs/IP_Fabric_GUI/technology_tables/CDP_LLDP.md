# CDP/LLDP

The Discovery Protocols section provides information about link layer discovery
protocols such as CDP and LLDP. 

**All neighbors** list information about all neighborships.

**Unmanaged neighbors** provide information for when a remote neighbor is not
accessible.

**Unidirectional neighbors** provide information when only one side can see the
neighborship, creating a unidirectional state.
