# Navigate in Tables

## Tables

Tables allow for analysis and correlation of network state information
and parameters on the fly. Most of the tables display live snapshot data
generated by graph algorithms without preexisting cache. The first load
of a table usually takes longer than subsequent loads, but all tables
were built to handle a large capacity and complex queries, so the
outcome should be better than analyzing the output in an external
application like Excel.

## Working with tables

An ARP technology table is used as an example below to demonstrate the
functionality of tables.

### Table description

You can get a short description of the current table via question mark button.

### Contextual help

Contextual help is displayed when a mouse cursor hovers over a table
icon or table header text.

### Searching for data / Filtering

Type in what you are looking for in most columns. The example below shows a
search for all devices with an IP address starting "10.41.133" throughout all
of the ARP tables in our infrastructure. Use

![clear filter](../../releases/known_issues/IP_Fabric/filter_clear_btn.png)

to clear the search results.

### Advanced Filtering

![Table advanced filter](table_advanced_filter.png)

If you need a more precise filter use *Advanced Filter*.

Filters are defined by groups and rules. Each group can contain on or
more rules or another group. There is always one root group which cannot
be deleted (number 1). Select the logical operator for each group. The
example below shows logical Or for the first group and logical And for
groups two and three.

What does example below do? It shows all devices with hostname `L47AC8`
AND interface `Et7/2` as well as devices with hostname `L43SD73` AND
interface `Et13/0`. In other words: "Show me all devices with hostname `L47AC8` which have
interface `Et7/2`, plus all devices with hostname `L43SD73` with interface
`Et13/0`.

### Share table view

![Sharing table](table_share.png)

The table view can be shared with other users.

### Colorize column

![Colorize column](table_colorize.png)

The table column can be colored based on predefined rules. Existing (as
well as default rules) are visible above table as *Reports* and can
be edited or removed.

To create a new rule, you need to specify _Rule name_, select the column to add
the color to -- _Colorized column_ and also, optionally, dashboard _Widgets_
(check [Dashboard documentation](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/dashboard.md) for more
details). Specify a filter rule to colorize the selected column:

1. Choose the color to apply rules to.
2. Add rules based on the same logic as described in advanced filtering section
   above.
3. A color can be designated as a _Default color_ which means that
   any other color becomes the default color if there is no match
   to any other rule.
4. Click _Update rule_

In the example below, all items in the `VRF` column which are named
`vrf4` will be colored red. A summary number of items which matches
this rule will also be displayed on _Dashboard_ in
the *Interfaces* widget.

### Display setting

![Display settings](table_display_settings.png)

Select what columns are displayed by choosing in _Column
Visibility_.

Enable _Sticky first column_ to fix the first column in case of
horizontal scrolling.

Enable *Sticky table header* to fix the table header in case of
vertical scrolling.

Tables' rows and text can be adjusted to small, medium or large sizes
with *Rows height adjust* .

### Export to CSV

![CSV Export](table_csv.png)

The current table view can be exported to CSV. This is useful for
additional data processing in an external application.

### Restore table setting

![Restore settings](table_restore.png)

Table filters and other settings can be restored using the *Restore
Table Settings* button. Colorization rules are not removed!
