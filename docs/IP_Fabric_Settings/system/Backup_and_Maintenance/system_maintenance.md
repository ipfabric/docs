# Schedule System Maintenance

Settings location: **Settings --> System --> Backup & Maintenance --> Schedule
System Maintenance**

To ensure the platform’s good health, it’s highly recommended to run the System
Maintenance on regular basis. The recommended frequency for the System
Maintenance is once a day.

Even though the process is very quick, we would recommend performing it when no
one is working with IP Fabric, as the platform is not available during the
maintenance.

Sometimes it is necessary to run the maintenance manually, this can be done with
the **Start Maintenance** button.
