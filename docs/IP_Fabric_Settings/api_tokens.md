# API tokens

Until release 3.7.0, the only available means of authenticating the API
calls from outside were either:
* username and password (to be able to login),
* or short-lived UI tokens generated by API sent as JWT along the
requests. There is also a refresh token that is used to renew the
short-lived UI tokens.

The information about the user, along with user’s permissions, are
encoded in the token itself, so once the UI token is issued, it cannot
be revoked (that’s why the tokens are typically short-lived).

Starting from 3.7.0 the API tokens (long-lived) were introduced for
authenticating API calls. They are a bit slower than UI tokens as the 
token is verified in DB with each API call, but they can be revoked easily.

To use API tokens, you need to generate them in UI.

Please note that the token string is visible / editable only when you
create the token, you will not see it or be able to modify it later.
For this reason, please make sure you copy the token string when creating
the API token in the UI.

To use the token, send it in `X-API-Token` HTTP header along the
request.

``` bash
$ curl -v -H "X-Api-Token: ${YOUR_TOKEN}" https://${IPF_HOST_PORT}/api/v5.0/api-tokens
```
