Starting version **6.1.0** IP Fabric supports Palo Alto Prisma SASE unified API.

For authentization [service account](https://pan.dev/sase/docs/service-accounts/) have to be created with RO role View Only Administrator or higher. PrismaÂ requires the following settings to be applied:

- **Username** -- Service account username
- **Password** -- Service account password

## Known Issues

Path lookup isn't fully supported. Currently Prisma SASE unified API doesn't have all needed endpoints.
