# Single Sign On (SSO)

IP Fabric uses [Dex (A Federated OpenID Connect Provider)](https://dexidp.io/) for **Single Sign On (SSO) Authentication**.

Implementation of SSO configuration is complex and because of that it
is configured for you by our IP Fabric Solution Architects.

If you are not sure who is your Solution Architect, contact our Support Team.

For more information about supported Dex SSO
connectors, see [official Dex documentation](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors).
