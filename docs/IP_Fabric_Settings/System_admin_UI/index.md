# Administrative Interface

For system status; backup and restore; upgrade; and administratorÂ tasks, IP
Fabric has a dedicated web-based administrative interface which is fully
separate from the primary system functions. The administrative interface is
available through port 8443. e.g. `https://ipfabric.company.com:8443` and uses
`osadmin` credentials defined during the [First Boot
Wizard](../../Getting_Started/platform_first_steps/01-deployment/).
