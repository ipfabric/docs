# Administrative Interface

## Administrative Interface

For [system
status](/system_administration/admin_ui/System_Status),
[backup and restore](/system_administration/admin_ui/Backup_and_restore), [upgrade](/system_administration/admin_ui/System_Update), and
administratorÂ tasks,
IP Fabric has a dedicated web-based administrative interface which is
fully separate from the primary system functions. The administrative
interface is available through port 8443. e.g.
<https://ipfabric.company.com:8443> and uses **osadmin** credentials
defined during the [First Boot
Wizard](/Getting_Started/platform_first_steps/01-deployment/).
