# AWS (Amazon Web Services)

## Configuring Access to AWS API

To add AWS to discovery, you will need an access key and secret access key from your AWS account. These keys can be found/generated under your account in the AWS
dashboard.

![AWS Management Console](aws/aws-management-console.png)

Click `My Security Credentials` and open the `Access keys` tab.

To generate keys, click **Create New Access Key**, and your keys will be
generated. These access keys are available globally for all of your AWS
regions.

Copy those keys to the AWS API settings in your IP Fabric, and don't
forget to **fill in the regions where the devices you want to discover
are located**. Multiple regions can be set for one API key and secret.

## Required IAM Policy

To ensure that IP Fabric can retrieve all the required data to model the
AWS networks, a series of specific policies are required to be applied
to the user account or role used for the API key. [IAM-policy-IPF_7.5.json](aws/IAM-policy-IPF_7.5.json)
contains a JSON description of the required IAM policies.

## AWS AssumeRole

IP Fabric enables you to add `AssumeRole` targets to AWS API configuration. `AssumeRole` is typically used for delegating access to additional resources/account in AWS. IP Fabric will iterate through all listed ARNs, call `AssumeRole` against those, and perform discovery on resources which became accessible.

!!! info "How `AssumeRole` Works"

    It returns a set of temporary access credentials that can be used to access
    AWS resources that the original account might not normally have access to. For
    more information about `AssumeRole`, see
    [AWS Security Token Service -- AssumeRole](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html).

!!! warning "Connection Testing Limitation"

    AWS configuration allows you to configure multiple roles and regions.
    However, connectivity testing has a limit on the number of tests you can
    perform. This is to prevent the testing from taking too much time. You can
    test up to 3 regions and 3 roles at a time, which means 9 tests in total.
    The AWS library also has a restriction on the number of parallel requests,
    which is 2.

    When trying to add more regions and roles, the test will fail with the
    following error:
