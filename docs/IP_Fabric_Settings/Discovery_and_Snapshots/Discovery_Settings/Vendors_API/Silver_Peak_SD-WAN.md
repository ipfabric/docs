# Silver Peak SD-WAN

Starting with version `4.3`, IP Fabric supports discovery of Silver Peak (Aruba) EdgeConnect devices in router mode.

EdgeConnect devices are discovered only through the API.

To add EdgeConnect to the global discovery settings, go to **Settings -->
Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery Settings --> Vendors API**, click **+ Add**,
select `Silver Peak` from the list, and fill in:

- **API key**, or
- **Username** and **Password** with **Login Type** (select `Local`, `RADIUS`, or `TACACS+`) to log in to Unity Orchestrator

  !!! info

      When RBAC is used, the user or API key must have at lest the **Monitor** role
      priviledges. If the user has only `read-only` permissions, all broadcast CLI API
      calls will **not** function. Consequently, the ARP table will **not** be collected.
      For all affected tasks, please refer to the [Feature Matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io).
      This is a known limitation of the orchestrator's API.
