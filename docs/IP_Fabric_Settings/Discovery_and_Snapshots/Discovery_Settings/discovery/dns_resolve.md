# DNS resolve

When this option is enabled, IP Fabric performs the IP address to a DNS name
translation. During the discovery process, this feature sends many requests to
the configured DNS servers.

To enable this option, go to **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery
Settings --> DNS resolve** and click the on/off switch.
