IP Fabric will attempt to connect to the default gateway of the VM and any
provided seed IP addresses. Once connected to a device, IP Fabric will identify
the vendor, model, and version, and adjust accordingly to run the
[necessary commands](https://matrix.ipfabric.io). You can read more about the
discovery process in
[How Discovery Works](../overview/How_Discovery_Works/CLI_discovery.md).

After the discovery is completed, all state data will be available, and you can
start exploring the [IP Fabric GUI](../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md).

**Enjoy using IP Fabric!**

If no devices are discovered, or if something is missing, please check this
