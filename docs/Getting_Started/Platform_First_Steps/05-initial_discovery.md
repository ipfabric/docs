    Now that you have entered the essential details, you can start the discovery!

## Option 1 -- via the Configuration Wizard

IP Fabric will attempt to connect to the default gateway of the VM and any
provided Seed IP Addresses. Once connected to a device, IP Fabric will
fingerprint the vendor, model, and version, and adjust accordingly to run
the [necessary commands](https://matrix.ipfabric.io). You can read more about
discovery process
at [How Discovery Works](../Overview/How_Discovery_Works/CLI_discovery.md).

After the discovery is completed, all of the state data is available and you can
start exploring [IP Fabric GUI](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md).

**Enjoy using IP Fabric!**

If no devices are discovered, or something is missing, check
this [documentation page](../Overview/How_Discovery_Works/common_problems/no-devices-discovered.md)
