# 10 - Schedule System Maintenance

To ensure the platform’s good health, it’s highly recommended to run the System Maintenance on regular basis. The recommended frequency for System Maintenance is once a day.

Even though the process is very quick, we would recommend performing it at a time when no one is working with the platform, as access is not available during the maintenance.
