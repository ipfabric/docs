# 09 - Schedule System Backup

![Schedule system backup](schedule_system_backup.png)
### Backup
Use IP Fabric backup to protect your important data.

There are two types of backup:

-   [Local backup](../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/system/system_backup.md#automatic-local-backups)

-   [Remote backup (FTP, sFTP)](../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/system/system_backup.md#automatic-remote-backups)

!!! tip Security tip

    Backups are encrypted with **osadmin** user password configured during the [first boot wizard](../01-deployment.md#complete-first-time-boot-wizard). When you lose **osadmin**  user password, backups are also lost!
