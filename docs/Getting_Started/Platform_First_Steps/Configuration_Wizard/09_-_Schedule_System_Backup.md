![Schedule system backup](schedule_system_backup.png)
### Backup
Use IP Fabric backup to protect your important data.

There are two types of backup:

-   [Local backup](../../../../System_Administration/Administrative_Interface/backup_and_restore/#local-backup)

-   [Remote backup (FTP, sFTP)](../../../../System_Administration/Administrative_Interface/backup_and_restore/#remote-backup)

!!! tip Security tip

    Backups are encrypted with *osadmin* user password configured during the [first boot wizard](../../../../Getting_Started/Platform_First_Steps/01-deployment/#complete-first-time-boot-wizard). When you lose *osadmin* user password, backups are also lost!
