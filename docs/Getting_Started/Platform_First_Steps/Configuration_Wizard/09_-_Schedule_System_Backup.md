![Schedule system backup](schedule_system_backup.png)
### Backup
Use IP Fabric backup to protect your important data.

There are two types of backup:

-   [Local backup](../../../System_Administration/Administrative_Interface/backup_and_restore.md#local-backup)

-   [Remote backup (FTP, sFTP)](../../../System_Administration/Administrative_Interface/backup_and_restore.md#remote-backup)

!!! tip Security tip

    Backups are encrypted with *osadmin* user password configured during the [first boot wizard](../01-deployment.md#complete-first-time-boot-wizard). When you lose *osadmin* user password, backups are also lost!
