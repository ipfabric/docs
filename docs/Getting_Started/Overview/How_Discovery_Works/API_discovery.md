# How API Discovery Works

Starting with version 3.8, the IP Fabric platform can combine the CLI (Command-Line Interface) discovery with API (Application Programming Interface) discovery.

Please, take into consideration connectivity requirements for the platform when planning to add cloud or SD-WAN vendors with API discovery. The API discovery is not automated and requires manually adding all necessary HTTP endpoint initiate connection to in the **Settings > Advanced > Vendors API**.

Please, visit the [Vendors API](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Settings_UI/advanced/Vendors_API/) section of the documentation.
