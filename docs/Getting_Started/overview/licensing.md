# Licensing

IP Fabric has a straightforward licensing concept. For every physical device, except access points, one license is used.

From **4.4.0** every device (virtual or physical) will consume one license. The only exception are still wireless access points, which wonâ€™t consume any license.

This will affect the following new vendors:

- SDWAN - Versa, Viptela, Silver peak

- Cloud wireless - Meraki, Juniper MIST

- Cloud Infrastructure - ASW, Azure
