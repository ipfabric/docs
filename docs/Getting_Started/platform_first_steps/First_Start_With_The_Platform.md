# First Start With The Platform

# Overview

IP Fabric is distributed as a single self-contained virtual machine. Distribution links contain current versions of the VM image files for the initial deployments and also update files offline for existing IP Fabric deployments (only versions 2.2.0 onward). The image files and the license file (distributed via a separate channel) are necessary to successfully complete the first start. Read-only network credentials are necessary to complete the first network discovery and analysis.
