# How API Discovery Works

Starting with version 3.8, the IP Fabric platform can combine the CLI (Command-Line Interface) discovery with API (Application Programming Interface) discovery.

Please take into consideration connectivity requirements for the platform when planning to add cloud or SD-WAN vendors with API discovery.

The API discovery is not automated and requires manually adding all necessary HTTP endpoints to initiate connection to in the **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery Settings --> Vendors API**.

Please visit the [Vendors API](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/index.md) section of the documentation.
