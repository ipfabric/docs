# Techsupport

!!! note "Techsupport data handling"

    A techsupport file uploaded to the `upload.ipfabric.io` server is stored
    there only temporarily. The file is eventually moved to a permanent location
    on Microsoft SharePoint. The `upload.ipfabric.io` server is only accessible
    to the IP Fabric Ops team, who facilitates the transfer to the permanent
    location. The file in the permanent location has configured strict RBAC
    rules allowing access to people at IP Fabric who need it for their work
    (such as support team, Network Automation Engineers etc.).

!!! info "Video tutorial"

    A techsupport file from the IP Fabric appliance is one of many ways how you
    can share the discovered data with our support team and engineers. This
    quick tutorial demonstrates how to generate the file and share it with us.
    The techsupport file is encrypted. Only IP Fabric support staff is able to
    decrypt the data.
