# Opengear

**Known affected platforms:** Opengear IM

**Description:** IP Fabric cannot detect the prompt if it contains only the `$`
(dollar) sign.

**Fix:** To discover Opengear with a `$`-only prompt, enable the needed
[feature flag](../../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#opengear-prompt-detection).
