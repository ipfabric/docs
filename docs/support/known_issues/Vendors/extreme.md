# Extreme Networks

**Known affected platforms:** Extreme ESR -- BOSS (formerly Nortel)

**Description:** BOSS allows empty spaces to be put into the prompt, which
breaks our prompt detection and prevents the device from being discovered.

**Fix:** Change the prompt so it doesn't contain empty spaces.
