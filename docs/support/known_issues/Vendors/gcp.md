# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**Known affected platforms:** `7.8`, `7.9`

**Description:** For Interconnect paths, the Cloud Router (control plane) appears in the path lookup.

**Description:** VPCs with subnets that share the same name across different regions show only one interface with that name in the table, and a Discovery Issue indicates that the interface is duplicated in the output. This will be updated in a future release.

**Description:** Using separate Vendor API configurations to discover Shared VPC host and service projects leads to inconsistent results.

**IP Fabric fix version:** This will be fixed in a future release.
