# Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

**IP Fabric version:** since From version `7.8` onward 

**Description:** For Interconnect paths, the Cloud Router (control plane) appears in the path lookup.

**Description:** VPCs with subnets that share the same name across different regions show only one interface with that name in the table, and a Discovery Issue indicates that the interface is duplicated in the output. This will be updated in a future release.

**IP Fabric fix version:** This will be fixed in a future release.
