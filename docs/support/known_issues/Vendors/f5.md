# F5

## Commands including `bash` require admin rights

** Known Affected Software Versions**: All

**Result**: Commands `run util bash -c uptime` for device uptime and `run util bash -c "ntpq -np"` for NTP peer server communications will not run without
 [administration permissions.](https://api-u.f5.com/support/kb-articles/K10272?pdf)

## Long timeout for command `show ltm virtual details`

** Known Affected Software Version**: All

**Description**: Command `show ltm virtual details` may hang for a long time before sending any response back to the user and discovery process can be stopped.

**Result**: Some F5 devices might not be discovered.

**Fix**: Test how long it takes to get data for this command via CLI and update [Network device session timeout](../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/SSH_telnet.md) accordingly.

## Long or infinite discovery due to `restjavad` frequent restarts because of insufficient memory

**Affected Product:** BIG-IP TMOS

For **Known Affected Software Versions** see [F5 documentation](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID776393.html).

**Description**: `show ltm virtual details` command may cause the `restjavad` daemon on F5 to restart, causing long or infinite discovery time.

**Result**: Some F5 devices might not be discovered.

**Fix**: Increase device memory for `restjavad` process, see [F5 Bug ID 776393](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID776393.html).

## SNMP passphrases appear to change each time during config backup

**Affected Versions:** all below 14.1.0 version

**Description:** When SNMPv3 users are configured with authentication and privacy passwords, the TMSH display of encrypted passwords appears to change at each redisplay. Same applies for getting the configuration file with `cd /;show running-config recursive` command.

**Environment:**
- TMSH
- SNMPv3
- Encrypted passwords

**Result:** IP Fabric considers every new F5 configuration file as `changed`.

**Fix:** Upgrade to a fixed version as noted in [Bug ID 532181](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID532181.html).
