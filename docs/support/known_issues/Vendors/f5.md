# F5

## Commands including `bash` require admin rights

**Known Affected Software Versions:** All

**Result:** Commands `run util bash -c uptime` for device uptime and `run util bash -c "ntpq -np"` for NTP peer server communications will not run without
 [administration permissions.](https://api-u.f5.com/support/kb-articles/K10272?pdf)

## Long timeout for command `show ltm virtual details`

**Known Affected Software Version:** All

**Description:** Command `show ltm virtual details` may hang for a long time before sending any response back to the user and the discovery process can be stopped.

**Result:** Some F5 devices might not be discovered.

**Fix:** Test how long it takes to get data for this command via CLI and update [Network device session timeout](../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/advanced_cli.md) accordingly.

## Long or infinite discovery due to `restjavad` frequent restarts because of insufficient memory

**Affected Product:** BIG-IP TMOS

For **Known Affected Software Versions** see [F5 documentation](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID776393.html).

**Description:** `show ltm virtual details` command may cause the `restjavad` daemon on F5 to restart, causing long or infinite discovery time.

**Result:** Some F5 devices might not be discovered.

**Fix:** Increase device memory for `restjavad` process, see [F5 Bug ID 776393](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID776393.html).

## SNMP passphrases appear to change each time during config backup

**Affected Versions:** all below 14.1.0 version

**Description:** When SNMPv3 users are configured with authentication and privacy passwords, the TMSH display of encrypted passwords appears to change at each redisplay. Same applies for getting the configuration file with `cd /;show running-config recursive` command.

**Environment:**

- TMSH
- SNMPv3
- Encrypted passwords

**Result:** IP Fabric considers every new F5 configuration file as `changed`.

**Fix:** Upgrade to a fixed version as noted in [Bug ID 532181](https://cdn.f5.com/product/bugtracker/ID532181.html).

## F5 device fails to discover due to `ASM out of memory error` 

**Affected Versions:** all versions

**Description:** When IP Fabric issues `show ltm virtual recursive` an error message pop up `Error Message: ASM out of memory error: event code X242/X260 Exceeded maximum memory assigned for XML/JSON processing` which halts the discovery process for the device.

**Environment:**

- ASM Policy configured to process XML Requests
- XML requests are not processed
- During the time of issue, logs like below are generated in the following directories:

**Result:** IP Fabric fails to discover the device.

**Fix:** Mitigation steps can be found on F5's page [K22526837](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K22526837).
## `Disk partition shared has only x % free` message causes infinite discovery

**Affected Versions:** all versions

**Description:** During discovery, if the device has full drive, it issues a syslog message to the shell every 3 minutes but default timeout for discovery is 5 minutes. This causes the discovery to never finish.

**Environment:**

- Disk space
- High Utilization

**Result:** IP Fabric discovery never finishes.

**Fix:** Mitigation steps can be found on F5's page [K15485103](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K15485103).
