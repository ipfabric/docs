# `a request xxx Failed to fetch HTTP status: 504` Followed by `Database seems to be overloaded`

Immediately after an upgrade or installation, `a request xxx Failed to fetch
HTTP status: 504` and `Database seems to be overloaded` messages might appear
after a successful login. This is due to index database maintenance. Please wait
some time and then attempt to log in to IP Fabric again. If the issue persists
for more than an hour, please do not hesitate to contact our Support team.
