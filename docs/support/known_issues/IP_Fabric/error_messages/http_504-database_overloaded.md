# `a request xxx Failed to fetch HTTP status: 504` followed by `Database seems to be overloaded`

Immediately after an upgrade or installation, error messages `a request
xxx Failed to fetch HTTP status: 504` and `Database seems to be
overloaded` might be shown after a successful login. This is because of
index database maintenance. Please wait some time and then try to login
to IP Fabric again. If it takes longer then an hour, don't hesitate to
contact our support team.
