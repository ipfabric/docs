# API Tech Note - Retrieving configurations

This tech note describes how you can retrieve configuration files from IP Fabricâ€™s configuration management capability, to be consumed outside the platform.

You do this in two stages:

1.  send a POST to **/tables/management/configuration** with a request body like

    ``` js
    {
      "columns":["_id", "hash", "hostname", "lastChange", "lastCheck", "reason", "sn", "status"],
      "snapshot":"$last"
    }
    ```
      
    You can of course filter that list (for example for devices containing "L36") with a `key:value` pair.

    ``` js
    "filters": {
                  "hostname": ["like","L36"]
                }
    ```

    

    This gives you the list of saved configurations, and most importantly, the "hash" for each.

2.  send a GET to **/tables/management/configuration/download?hash=XXXXXXXXXXXXX** where XXXXXXXXXXXXX is the hash for the required config from the list returned in step 1.  
    This returns the plain text of the configuration in question.
