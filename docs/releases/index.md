# IP Fabric Releases

!!! important "Current release"

    The current major release is `6.1` please check the [detailed release
    notes](release_notes/6.1.md) for this release.

Our release naming follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Where
components of the version are `major.minor.patch+build`:

- `major` version changes if we introduce a change (typically backwards
  incompatible) touching APIs, deployment or key component of the platform.
- `minor` version means a significant change, typically a new feature being
  added. These are typically backwards compatible and we also keep the promise
  of API compatibility.
- `patch` releases are frequently a bugfix releases.
- `build` is an internal version which increases with every internal build,
  thus can be pretty large number. It is used to distinguish between different
  packages.
