## `v7.5.0` (UNRELEASED)

### Improvements

#### GUI

- File names of exported graphs were improved. Instead of naming all files `graph`, the file name
  now consists of basic view information (saved view name, site name or path lookup IPs) and a timestamp.
- The attribute filter in the header now displays attributes and values from all loaded snapshots, clearly
  marking those that are not present in the currently selected snapshot. This change eliminates various glitches
  when a different snapshot is selected while having the attribute filter active.
- The "Snapshot Retention" page has been renamed to "Snapshot Collection," with a corresponding URL update. This change more accurately reflects the content and purpose of the pages.
- The snapshot management system has undergone a redesign to enhance usability and efficiency, 
  particularly when dealing with extensive sets of snapshots. Key improvements include:
  - Categorization by Time Period: Snapshots are intuitively organized based on their creation time.
  - Filtering by Name: Users can easily filter snapshots by their names.
