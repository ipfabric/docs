# IP Fabric `v7.5`

!!! danger "Unreleased Version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

## Backward compatibility

- Snapshots from release `5.X` and earlier are not supported and may fail to load properly.

## Known Issues

### Performance Limitations

- The Wireless AP table may load very slowly.
- The XDP Unidirectional Neighbors table may be unable to load.
- During snapshot loading, the GUI may become unresponsive, requiring a page refresh.
- **Computing Intent Verification Rules** during the loading of an existing snapshot or the creation of a new snapshot (as part of pre-discovery calculations)
may take longer than expected, as this process is not yet optimized. Performance improvements are planned and will be included in an upcoming patch release.

  !!! Hint

      The duration of the computation depends on the number of currently loaded snapshots. To reduce the time spent on Computing Intent Verification Rules,
      it is recommended to minimize the number of loaded snapshots.

### Database Migration Issues

- In rare cases, Vendor API credentials may not migrate correctly to the PSQL database and may require re-entry.
- BGP community settings may not import correctly and may need reconfiguration.

### Multicast Path-Lookup Not Working

Multicast path lookups are displayed incorrectly due to an error in the end-to-end algorithm.

### Duplicate Data on Security-Related Tables

Using filters may result in duplicate entries in security-related tables such as NAT44 and ACL.

### RBAC Policies

When updating or creating RBAC policies, the following endpoints cannot be configured:

```
POST /support/callhome
GET /support/vpn-start
GET /support/vpn-status
GET /support/vpn-stop
```

## v7.5.4 (UNRELEASED; EA)

### New Features

#### Time-Based Filtering for Discovery History Seeds

We have introduced a new setting that allows users to precisely control which IP addresses from Discovery History are reused as seeds.

**API Extension**

This feature is configurable through a new `discoveryHistorySeeds` attribute in the existing `PATCH /settings` API. The attribute accepts an object with these properties:

`enabled` *(required)* – Enables/disables seed reuse from Discovery History
`daysLimit` *(optional)* – Restricts seed reuse to IPs discovered within the last X days
`afterDate` *(optional)* – Restricts seed reuse to IPs discovered after a specified date

!!! Note

    `daysLimit` and `afterDate` are mutually exclusive — only one may be configured at a time.

**Use Cases**

| Scenario | Configuration |
|--|--|
| **Current Behavior** -- Use all IPs from Discovery History | `{ enabled: true }` |
| **Disable seed reuse** | `{ enabled: false }` (preserves existing `daysLimit`/`afterDate` values)|
| **Use only IPs discovered in the last 7 days** | `{ enabled: true, daysLimit: 7 }`|
| **Use only IPs discovered after June 1, 2025** | `{ enabled: true, afterDate: "2025-06-01" }` |


#### AWS Cloud

- **AWS Cloud WAN** -- Basic support for AWS Global and Core Networks. A new device type, "AWS Core Network Edge", will be discovered.
Basic routing between attached VPC and core network segments is supported. Additional improvements, such as better support for
Network Function Groups and connectivity to Direct Connect Gateways, will be added in upcoming releases.


!!! Warning "Don't forget to update IAM policy"

    In order to collect AWS Cloud WAN network data, the relevant IAM policy must be updated first.
    You can find the updated IAM policy for IPF 7.5 [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/aws/IAM-policy-IPF_7.5.json).
    There are three changes compared to the previous version:

      1. The entire **IAM policy for EC2 has been simplified**. Instead of listing each action individually, actions are now grouped
      (`ec2:DescribeVpcs`, `ec2:DescribeSubnets`, ... => `ec2:Describe*`). The complete list of actions can still be found in the [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io/).

      2. A new statement for **networkmanager** (Cloud WAN) has been added:

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricNetworkManager",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "networkmanager:Describe*",
              "networkmanager:Get*",
              "networkmanager:List*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }
      ```

      3. A new statement for **autoscaling** has been added (related to upcoming improvements for EC2 instances).

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricAutoScaling",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "autoscaling:Describe*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      },
      ```

### Improvements

#### GUI

- File names of exported graphs were improved. Instead of naming all files `graph`, the file name
  now consists of basic view information (saved view name, site name or path lookup IPs) and a timestamp.
- VRF labels are now displayed as line-cap labels on topology graph edges for Layer 3 protocols, making it easier to identify VRF associations directly within the graph.
- The attribute filter in the header now displays attributes and values from all loaded snapshots, clearly
  marking those that are not present in the currently selected snapshot. This change eliminates various glitches
  when a different snapshot is selected while having the attribute filter active.
- The "Snapshot Retention" page has been renamed to "Snapshot Collection," with a corresponding URL update. This change more accurately reflects the content and purpose of the pages.
- The snapshot management system has undergone a redesign to enhance usability and efficiency,
  particularly when dealing with extensive sets of snapshots. Key improvements include:
  - Categorization by Time Period: Snapshots are intuitively organized based on their creation time.
  - Filtering by Name: Users can easily filter snapshots by their names.
- **Hostname** and **IP address** typeahead suggestions in the **Path Lookup** forms within **Diagrams** now respect the **Attribute filters** applied in the top bar.

#### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- **STP per-VLAN (1x1) mode support** -- Added support for **Spanning Tree Protocol in per-VLAN (1x1)** mode on **Alcatel OmniSwitch** devices.

- Added support for multi-segment routing for VeloCloud (only IPv4).
- Added support for the MAC address table on Meraki switches.
- Added mapping for STP port statuses on Meraki switches.
- A new task Cloud Subnets was added to save more information related to cloud subnets in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Scaling Groups was added to save more information related to scaling groups in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Interface Endpoints was added to save more information related to interface endpoints in the device JSON.
- Tables in **Technology → Cloud → Endpoints** now also include instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode.
- Added support for F5 rSeries (F5OSA) and F5 VELOS (F5OSC) discovery.

  !!! warning "Do not forget to update IAM policy"

      To collect VM instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode, the corresponding IAM policy must be updated.
      You can download the new policy [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/azure/azure-role-7_5.json).

#### Configuration Management

- Configuration Management now fully supports IPv6-configured devices with all available functionalities.
- Added support for Cisco Viptela (Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN) when [API+CLI combined discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Cisco_Viptela_SD-WAN.md) is configured.

### API Changes

#### Deprecated URL Path Versioning of API Endpoints

With this release, we are deprecating URL path versioning of API endpoints in favor of a header-based approach.
For migration instructions, please refer to the [Versioning](../../IP_Fabric_API/versioning.md#api-version-in-url-path-deprecated) page.

#### Optional Data in API Responses

In previous versions, optional fields were omitted from certain API responses if they were not set. As of this release, optional fields are explicitly included with a `null` value when unset.

#### Technology Tables

- The following column operations are no more supported:
  - Cross-column on text and text array column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg`
  - Cross-column on IP and IPv6 column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - Cross-column on routing and IPv6 routing column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - On columns referencing external entities: `ieq`, `nieq`, `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `ireg`, `nreg`, `nireg`
- Cross-column operations are now limited by type (e.g. IP column cannot be compared to number column)
- Regular expressions now use the **POSIX** standard instead of **ECMAScript**: saved filters and intent checks using `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg` operations may be affected
- Type coercion is no more supported (e.g. string `'123'` will not pass validation if a number is expected)

### Other Changes

- Feature flag `ENABLE_ACI_FVTENANT` **was removed**
- **Routing tables** in Device Explorer **were renamed**:

  - `Cumulative IPv4 routing table` → **IPv4 routing table**
  - `Cumulative IPv6 routing table` → **IPv6 routing table**

  *(Data, URLs, and structure remain unchanged; original names were misleading)*  

- **Added documentation link** to Support Menu: `API Documentation`
- **Enhanced Feature Matrix** with IPv6 support indicators:

  - Added toggle filter to show/hide IPv6 support information
