# IP Fabric v7.5

!!! danger "Upgrade Notice"

    An upgrade to `7.5.x` or later is **only** possible from release `7.3.17`.

    When upgrading to `7.5` release, database will be migrated from **ArangoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.

    For detailed upgrade guide, see [Upgrade Guide for **7.5** Release](#upgrade-guide-for-75-release).

    Note that [hardware requirements](../../overview/index.md#hardware-requirements) differ from previous releases.

    We strongly recommend installing release `7.5` only on secondary instances within the EA program.

    Before upgrading, review the [API Changes](#api-changes),
    [Backward Compatibility](#backward-compatibility) and [Known Issues](#known-issues) sections.

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

## Backward Compatibility

- Snapshots from release `5.x` and earlier are not supported and may fail to load properly.

## Upgrade Guide for **7.5** Release

This guide walks you through a safe, in-place upgrade from IP Fabric `v7.3` (or newer) to `v7.5`,
which in turn migrates the database from **ArangoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.
---

### Before You Begin

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Supported Starting Version** | Your appliance must be on the latest version of **v7.3**. |
| **Hardware** | **We highly recommend using directly attached NVMe storage.** Minimum requirements: **8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM**. For more information, see [Hardware Requirements](../../overview/index.md#hardware-requirements). <div class="admonition info"><p class="admonition-title">Why NVMe storage?</p><p>PostgreSQL’s performance relies heavily on fast random I/O. Rotary (HDD) storage is no longer supported for production.</p></div> |
| **Downtime** | Plan a maintenance window of **2+ hours**, depending on snapshot sizes, amount and hardware performance. |
| **Backup** | Take a **hypervisor snapshot** *after shutting down* the VM (cold snapshot). |
| **Benchmark** | Run `sudo ipf-checker -d -s` to measure disk performance. This is an informational test only. (**Note:** The test saturates the appliance, takes approximately 5-6 minutes, and should be scheduled during off-hours.) |
| **Customer Support** | Have your IP Fabric Support contact handy in case questions arise. You can also [submit a ticket](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) to our service desk. |

??? note "Step 1 - Plan & Notify"
    1. Make sure that prerequisites above are met.
    2. Schedule a downtime window and inform stakeholders that the appliance will be offline.

??? note "Step 2 - Prepare the Appliance"
    1. Shut down the appliance gracefully [from the CLI](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/troubleshooting.md#reboot-and-shutdown).
    2. Create a cold snapshot in your hypervisor; verify its completion.
    3. Power the appliance back on.

??? note "Step 3 - Launch the `v7.5` Upgrade"
    1. Follow [offline update manual](../../System_Administration/system_update.md#offline-update) or set [EA release channel](#release-channels) to receive online updates.
    2. The upgrade will:

       - Export configuration and snapshots
       - Stop services
       - Install `v7.5` components
       - Start services and migrate data to **PostgreSQL**
       - Import configuration and snapshots

    3. After completing the upgrade, proceed to Step 4, if any issues occur during the process, please contact our [Support Team](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1) for assistance.

??? note "Step 4 - Post-upgrade Validation"
    1. Log in to the UI, ensure all settings and snapshots have been migrated.
    2. Launch a Discovery and verify that it finishes.
    3. Optionally run a quick API request or path lookup to confirm core functionality.
    4. Observe CPU, RAM usage to ensure the VM is not overloaded.
    5. Run disk performance benchmark
       ```shell
       sudo ipf-checker -d -s
       ```
       Save the output for future reference. If possible, we would appreciate you sharing this output with our team through the [Support Portal](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

## Known Issues

### Performance Limitations

- **Snapshot Processing:** Snapshot loading and discovery times may increase as the number of loaded snapshots grows. It is recommended to gradually
 increase the snapshot load limit in small increments to avoid extended load times.
- **Intent Verification Rules:** The computation of Intent Verification Rules during snapshot loading or creation may take longer than expected.
 This process is not yet optimized, but performance improvements will be included in an upcoming patch release.
- **Table Loading Performance:** Some tables may experience longer loading times when a large number of snapshots is loaded. Please contact customer support if you experience such a case.
- During snapshot loading, the GUI may become unresponsive, requiring a page refresh.
- The **xDP Unidirectional Neighbors** table may be unable to load.

  !!! Hint

      To improve performance, particularly when computing Intent Verification Rules, minimize the number of loaded snapshots.

### Database Migration Issues

- BGP community settings may not import correctly and may need reconfiguration.

## v7.5.6 (August 15th, 2025; EA)

### New Features

#### Time-Based Filtering for Discovery History Seeds

We have introduced a new setting that allows users to precisely control which IP addresses from Discovery History are reused as seeds.

**API Extension**

This feature is configurable through a new `discoveryHistorySeeds` attribute in the existing `PATCH /settings` API. The attribute accepts an object with these properties:

`enabled` *(required)* – Enables/disables seed reuse from Discovery History
`daysLimit` *(optional)* – Restricts seed reuse to IPs discovered within the last X days
`afterDate` *(optional)* – Restricts seed reuse to IPs discovered after a specified date

!!! Note

    `daysLimit` and `afterDate` are mutually exclusive — only one may be configured at a time.

**Use Cases**

| Scenario | Configuration |
|--|--|
| **Current Behavior** -- Use all IPs from Discovery History | `{ enabled: true }` |
| **Disable seed reuse** | `{ enabled: false }` (preserves existing `daysLimit`/`afterDate` values)|
| **Use only IPs discovered in the last 7 days** | `{ enabled: true, daysLimit: 7 }`|
| **Use only IPs discovered after June 1, 2025** | `{ enabled: true, afterDate: "2025-06-01" }` |


#### AWS Cloud

- **AWS Cloud WAN** -- Basic support for AWS Global and Core Networks. A new device type, "AWS Core Network Edge", will be discovered.
Basic routing between attached VPC and core network segments is supported. Additional improvements, such as better support for
Network Function Groups and connectivity to Direct Connect Gateways, will be added in upcoming releases.


!!! Warning "Don't forget to update IAM policy"

    In order to collect AWS Cloud WAN network data, the relevant IAM policy must be updated first.
    You can find the updated IAM policy for IPF 7.5 [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/aws/IAM-policy-IPF_7.5.json).
    There are three changes compared to the previous version:

      1. The entire **IAM policy for EC2 has been simplified**. Instead of listing each action individually, actions are now grouped
      (`ec2:DescribeVpcs`, `ec2:DescribeSubnets`, ... => `ec2:Describe*`). The complete list of actions can still be found in the [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io/).

      2. A new statement for **networkmanager** (Cloud WAN) has been added:

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricNetworkManager",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "networkmanager:Describe*",
              "networkmanager:Get*",
              "networkmanager:List*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }
      ```

      3. A new statement for **autoscaling** has been added (related to upcoming improvements for EC2 instances).

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricAutoScaling",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "autoscaling:Describe*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      },
      ```

#### F5OS

- **F5OSa & F5OSc** -- Basic API discovery support is available for both F5OS systems. As these systems run on F5 chassis, we have implemented support primarily for inventory, SN, and devInfo tasks. Network coverage is limited. Complex management and inventory of chassis and its objects is planned for future releases.

!!! Warning "Discovery via api"

    F5OS is discovered via API. You need to configure API vendors for successful discovery. Otherwise, all tenants running TMOS are discovered using SSH.

### Improvements

#### GUI

- File names of exported graphs were improved. Instead of naming all files `graph`, the file name
  now consists of basic view information (saved view name, site name or path lookup IPs) and a timestamp.
- VRF labels are now displayed as line-cap labels on topology graph edges for Layer 3 protocols, making it easier to identify VRF associations directly within the graph.
- The attribute filter in the header now displays attributes and values from all loaded snapshots, clearly
  marking those that are not present in the currently selected snapshot. This change eliminates various glitches
  when a different snapshot is selected while having the attribute filter active.
- The "Snapshot Retention" page has been renamed to "Snapshot Collection," with a corresponding URL update. This change more accurately reflects the content and purpose of the pages.
- The snapshot management system has undergone a redesign to enhance usability and efficiency,
  particularly when dealing with extensive sets of snapshots. Key improvements include:
  - Categorization by Time Period: Snapshots are intuitively organized based on their creation time.
  - Filtering by Name: Users can easily filter snapshots by their names.
- **Hostname** and **IP address** typeahead suggestions in the **Path Lookup** forms within **Diagrams** now respect the **Attribute filters** applied in the top bar.

#### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- **STP per-VLAN (1x1) mode support** -- Added support for **Spanning Tree Protocol in per-VLAN (1x1)** mode on **Alcatel OmniSwitch** devices.
- Added support for the FortiGate AAA task.
- Added support for the FortiGate OSPFv3 task.
- Added support for the Cisco ACI AAA task.
- Added support for the Cisco ACI SNMP task.
- Added IPv6 support for the Cisco IOS-XE IS-IS task.
- Added IPv6 support for the Cisco ASA BGP Neighbors task.
- Added support for multi-segment routing for VeloCloud (only IPv4).
- Added support for the MAC address table on Meraki switches.
- Added mapping for STP port statuses on Meraki switches.
- A new task Cloud Subnets was added to save more information related to cloud subnets in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Endpoint Groups was added to save more information related to scaling and endpoint groups in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Interface Endpoints was added to save more information related to interface endpoints in the device JSON.
- Tables in **Technology → Cloud → Endpoints** now also include instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode.
- Added support for F5 rSeries (F5OSA) and F5 VELOS (F5OSC) discovery.

  !!! warning "Do not forget to update IAM policy"

      To collect VM instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode, the corresponding IAM policy must be updated.
      You can download the new policy [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/azure/azure-role-7_5.json).

#### Configuration Management

- Configuration Management now fully supports IPv6-configured devices with all available functionalities.
- Added support for Cisco Viptela (Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN) when [API+CLI combined discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Cisco_Viptela_SD-WAN.md) is configured.

#### Release Channels

- If you are part of the EA program, you can configure your staging instance to use the EA [release channel](../../System_Administration/system_update.md#release-channels) to receive online upgrades when new versions become available. Please contact your IP Fabric Solution Architect or Customer Success Manager to obtain the current EA release channel name.


### API Changes

#### Deprecated URL Path Versioning of API Endpoints

With this release, we are deprecating URL path versioning of API endpoints in favor of a header-based approach.
For migration instructions, please refer to the [Versioning](../../IP_Fabric_API/versioning.md#api-version-in-url-path-deprecated) page.

#### Optional Data in API Responses

In previous versions, optional fields were omitted from certain API responses if they were not set. As of this release, optional fields are explicitly included with a `null` value when unset.

#### Technology Tables

- The following column operations are no more supported:
  - Cross-column on text and text array column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg`
  - Cross-column on IP and IPv6 column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - Cross-column on routing and IPv6 routing column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - On columns referencing external entities: `ieq`, `nieq`, `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `ireg`, `nreg`, `nireg`
- Cross-column operations are now limited by type (e.g. IP column cannot be compared to number column)
- Regular expressions now use the **POSIX** standard instead of **ECMAScript**: saved filters and intent checks using `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg` operations may be affected
- Type coercion is no more supported (e.g. string `'123'` will not pass validation if a number is expected)

#### Removed Technology Tables

- The following previously deprecated table has been removed:
  - **Table:** `/technology/platforms/vdc/vdc-devices`
  - **API endpoint:** `/tables/platforms/vdc/devices`

### Other Changes

- Feature flag [`ENABLE_ACI_FVTENANT_ENDPOINT`](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#aci-fvtenant-api-endpoint-removed-in-75) **was removed**
- **Routing tables** in Device Explorer **were renamed**:
  - `Cumulative IPv4 routing table` → **IPv4 routing table**
  - `Cumulative IPv6 routing table` → **IPv6 routing table**
  *(Data, URLs, and structure remain unchanged; original names were misleading)*
- **Added documentation link** to Support Menu: `API Documentation`
- **Enhanced Feature Matrix** with IPv6 support indicators:
  - Added toggle filter to show/hide IPv6 support information
- The current status of the PostgreSQL database is now displayed on the [Status Page](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/tips/system_status.md) page.
  - From this page, users can also restart the PostgreSQL database if necessary.
