## Upgrade Guide for **7.5** Release

This guide walks you through a safe upgrade from IP Fabric `v7.3.23` (or newer) to `v7.5`
which in turn migrates the database from **ArangoDB** to **PostgreSQL**.

Migrating to **PostgreSQL** will accelerate delivery of **future IP Fabric features and enhancements**, enabling greater scalability.

We appreciate your cooperation in following the guide above closely to ensure a seamless upgrade.

!!! info

    If you need further guidance, please reach out to our team -- [Support Portal](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

## Before You Begin

Upgrading from **7.3 (ArangoDB)** to **7.5 (PostgreSQL)** introduces significant changes in database architecture and hardware requirements. Please review these three prerequisites carefully:

### 1. Understand Key Changes

- **Database backend** moves from ArangoDB to PostgreSQL for improved scalability and performance.
- PostgreSQL relies on **disk performance** (IOPS, latency, throughput), unlike ArangoDB which was memory-heavy.

### 2. Hardware Requirements

- **7.5** introduces significant changes in hardware requirements, please validate hardware sizing, see [hardware requirements](../../overview/index.md#hardware-requirements) and [IOPS requirements](../../overview/index.md#minimal-iops-requirements).
- Ensure [VM drivers](../../platform_first_steps/01-deployment.md#setting-vm-from-scratch-importing-vmdk-image) are optimized for fast disk operations.   
- Use **directly attached NVMe or SSD storage** (avoid network-attached disks).


### 3. Pre-Upgrade Check

- Run `sudo ipf-checker -d -s` on your `7.3.23` instance or newer.
- From `7.3.23` onward, the check runs automatically during upgrade and **halts if any test fails**.
- Share failing results with [IP Fabric Support](https://ipfabric.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).
- Plan a maintenance window of **2+ hours**, depending on snapshot sizes, amount and hardware performance.
- Take a **hypervisor snapshot** *after shutting down* the VM (cold snapshot).

    - **Note:** Some items require manual steps, see [FAQ](7.5_FAQ.md#5-settings-snapshot-migration).

??? note "Step 5 -- Migrate Snapshots"

    - On 7.3: [Download snapshots](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#download-snapshots) individually.
    - On 7.5: [Load snapshots](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#load-snapshot-from-file) from file one by one.
   
??? note "Step 6 -- Final Validation"

    - Run initial discovery on the new instance.
    - Adjust discovery times between old and new instance to avoid running discovery at the same time.
    - Operate both instances for several days before decommissioning 7.3.

### Option C: In-Place Upgrade

??? note "Step 1 -- Validate Hardware"

    - Confirm your current instance meets [Hardware Requirements](../../overview/index.md#hardware-requirements).

??? note "Step 2 -- Run Pre-Upgrade Checker"

    - Execute `sudo ipf-checker -d -s` and review results - **make sure it passes all tests**.
    - Share results with IP Fabric Support if needed.
   
??? note "Step 3 -- Prepare the Appliance"
    1. Shut down the appliance gracefully [from the CLI](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/troubleshooting.md#reboot-and-shutdown).
    2. Adjust hardware sizing and drivers if needed.
    3. Create a cold snapshot in your hypervisor; verify its completion.
    4. Power the appliance back on.
   
??? note "Step 4 -- Apply Upgrade Package"

    - Use the provided GA release package for `7.5`, see [System Update](../../System_Administration/system_update.md#update).
   
??? note "Step 5 -- Post-Upgrade Validation"

    - Run a new discovery and verify that all devices has been found.

## Known Issues

### Performance Limitations

- **Snapshot Processing:** Snapshot load and discovery time may increase as the number of loaded snapshots grows. With more loaded snapshots, post-discovery calculation time increases by **~10% per snapshot**. For example with 5 loaded snapshots, calculation time may increase by ~30–50%. We are actively working on mitigating this slowness.

- **Intent Verification Rules:** The computation of Intent Verification Rules during snapshot loading or creation may take longer than expected.
 This process is not yet optimized, but performance improvements will be included in an upcoming patch release.

  !!! Hint

      To improve performance, particularly when computing Intent Verification Rules, minimize the number of loaded snapshots.

- **Table Loading Performance:** For the majority of commonly used tables, we have optimized their performance. We are currently working on optimizing the performance of other tables. Please actively report any table that exhibit slow performance, and we will promptly address and improve their performance.

### Extensions Migration

When upgrading from version `7.3` to `7.5`, **Extensions are not migrated**.

If your deployment uses the Extensions feature, please **remove all extensions before upgrading**, and **re-import them manually** after the upgrade. This serves as a temporary workaround until the migration process is fully supported.

If extensions are **not removed prior to the upgrade**, they will continue to run in the background but **will not appear in the GUI** and **will be inaccessible**.

### Backward Compatibility

- Snapshots from release `5.x` and earlier are not supported and may fail to load properly.

## v7.5.6 (August 15th, 2025; EA)

### New Features

#### Time-Based Filtering for Discovery History Seeds

We have introduced a new setting that allows users to precisely control which IP addresses from Discovery History are reused as seeds.
See [Time-Based Filtering for Discovery History Seeds](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery_seeds.md#time-based-filtering-for-discovery-history-seeds) documentation
for how to configure it.

#### AWS Cloud

- **AWS Cloud WAN** -- Basic support for AWS Global and Core Networks. A new device type, "AWS Core Network Edge", will be discovered.
Basic routing between attached VPC and core network segments is supported. Additional improvements, such as better support for
Network Function Groups and connectivity to Direct Connect Gateways, will be added in upcoming releases.


!!! Warning "Don't forget to update IAM policy"

    In order to collect AWS Cloud WAN network data, the relevant IAM policy
    must be updated first. You can find the updated IAM policies for IPF 7.5
    [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/AWS_Amazon_Web_Services.md).
    Together with fully granular version of IAM policy, we provide also a
    simplified version where:

      1. The entire **IAM policy for EC2 has been simplified**. Instead of
         listing each action individually, actions are now grouped
         (`ec2:DescribeVpcs`, `ec2:DescribeSubnets`, ... => `ec2:Describe*`).
         The complete list of actions can still be found in the
         [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io/).

      2. A new statement for **networkmanager** (Cloud WAN) has been added:

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricNetworkManager",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "networkmanager:Describe*",
              "networkmanager:Get*",
              "networkmanager:List*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      }
      ```

      3. A new statement for **autoscaling** has been added (related to upcoming improvements for EC2 instances).

      ```
      {
          "Sid": "IPFabricAutoScaling",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "autoscaling:Describe*"
          ],
          "Resource": "*"
      },
      ```

#### F5OS

- **F5OSa & F5OSc** -- Basic API discovery support is available for both F5OS systems. As these systems run on F5 chassis, we have implemented support primarily for inventory, SN, and devInfo tasks. Network coverage is limited. Complex management and inventory of chassis and its objects is planned for future releases.

!!! Warning "Discovery via api"

    F5OS is discovered via API. You need to configure API vendors for successful discovery. Otherwise, all tenants running TMOS are discovered using SSH.

### Improvements

#### GUI

- File names of exported graphs were improved. Instead of naming all files `graph`, the file name
  now consists of basic view information (saved view name, site name or path lookup IPs) and a timestamp.
- VRF labels are now displayed as line-cap labels on topology graph edges for Layer 3 protocols, making it easier to identify VRF associations directly within the graph.
- The attribute filter in the header now displays attributes and values from all loaded snapshots, clearly
  marking those that are not present in the currently selected snapshot. This change eliminates various glitches
  when a different snapshot is selected while having the attribute filter active.
- The "Snapshot Retention" page has been renamed to "Snapshot Collection," with a corresponding URL update. This change more accurately reflects the content and purpose of the pages.
- The snapshot management system has undergone a redesign to enhance usability and efficiency,
  particularly when dealing with extensive sets of snapshots. Key improvements include:
  - Categorization by Time Period: Snapshots are intuitively organized based on their creation time.
  - Filtering by Name: Users can easily filter snapshots by their names.
- **Hostname** and **IP address** typeahead suggestions in the **Path Lookup** forms within **Diagrams** now respect the **Attribute filters** applied in the top bar.
- Export to CSV feature in tables now requires policy access to the `Prepared requests` endpoints, which are included in the default `tables` policy.

#### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- **STP per-VLAN (1x1) mode support** -- Added support for **Spanning Tree Protocol in per-VLAN (1x1)** mode on **Alcatel OmniSwitch** devices.
- Added support for the FortiGate AAA task.
- Added support for the FortiGate OSPFv3 task.
- Added support for the Cisco ACI AAA task.
- Added support for the Cisco ACI SNMP task.
- Added IPv6 support for the Cisco IOS-XE IS-IS task.
- Added IPv6 support for the Cisco ASA BGP Neighbors task.
- Added support for multi-segment routing for VeloCloud (only IPv4).
- Added support for the MAC address table on Meraki switches.
- Added mapping for STP port statuses on Meraki switches.
- A new task Cloud Subnets was added to save more information related to cloud subnets in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Endpoint Groups was added to save more information related to scaling and endpoint groups in the device JSON.
- A new task Cloud Interface Endpoints was added to save more information related to interface endpoints in the device JSON.
- Tables in **Technology → Cloud → Endpoints** now also include instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode.
- Added support for F5 rSeries (F5OSA) and F5 VELOS (F5OSC) discovery.

  !!! warning "Do not forget to update IAM policy"

      To collect VM instances from Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets in Uniform mode, the corresponding IAM policy must be updated.
      You can download the new policy [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/azure/azure-role-7_5.json).

#### Configuration Management

- Configuration Management now fully supports IPv6-configured devices with all available functionalities.
- Added support for Cisco Viptela (Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN) when [API+CLI combined discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Cisco_Viptela_SD-WAN.md) is configured.

#### Release Channels

- If you are part of the EA program, you can configure your staging instance to use the EA [release channel](../../System_Administration/system_update.md#release-channels) to receive online upgrades when new versions become available. Please contact your IP Fabric Solution Architect or Customer Success Manager to obtain the current EA release channel name.


### API Changes

#### Deprecated URL Path Versioning of API Endpoints

With this release, we are deprecating URL path versioning of API endpoints in favor of a header-based approach.
For migration instructions, please refer to the [Versioning](../../IP_Fabric_API/versioning.md#api-version-in-url-path-deprecated) page.

#### Optional Data in API Responses

In previous versions, optional fields were omitted from certain API responses if they were not set. As of this release, optional fields are explicitly included with a `null` value when unset.

#### Technology Tables

- The following column operations are no more supported:
  - Cross-column on text and text array column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg`
  - Cross-column on IP and IPv6 column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - Cross-column on routing and IPv6 routing column: `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `nreg`
  - On columns referencing external entities: `ieq`, `nieq`, `like`, `notlike`, `reg`, `ireg`, `nreg`, `nireg`
- Cross-column operations are now limited by type (e.g. IP column cannot be compared to number column)
- Regular expressions now use the **POSIX** standard instead of **ECMAScript**: saved filters and intent checks using `reg`, `nreg`, `ireg`, `nireg` operations may be affected
- Type coercion is no more supported (e.g. string `'123'` will not pass validation if a number is expected)

#### Removed Technology Tables

- The following previously deprecated table has been removed:
  - **Table:** `/technology/platforms/vdc/vdc-devices`
  - **API endpoint:** `/tables/platforms/vdc/devices`

### Other Changes

- Feature flag [`ENABLE_ACI_FVTENANT_ENDPOINT`](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#aci-fvtenant-api-endpoint-removed-in-75) **was removed**
- **Routing tables** in Device Explorer **were renamed**:
  - `Cumulative IPv4 routing table` → **IPv4 routing table**
  - `Cumulative IPv6 routing table` → **IPv6 routing table**
  *(Data, URLs, and structure remain unchanged; original names were misleading)*
- **Added documentation link** to Support Menu: `API Documentation`
- **Enhanced Feature Matrix** with IPv6 support indicators:
  - Added toggle filter to show/hide IPv6 support information
- The current status of the PostgreSQL database is now displayed on the [Status Page](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/tips/system_status.md) page.
  - From this page, users can also restart the PostgreSQL database if necessary.
