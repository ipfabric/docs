### Features - Protocol and technology support

- Arista - added ACL support
- Check Point Gaia - added VRRP support
- Cisco - AAA - new local users table added, located at Technology /
  Management / AAA / Local users
- Cisco IOS-XR - added ACL support
- Cisco IOS-XR - added support for port channels
- Extreme XOS - Add support for switchport
- Juniper JunOS - added support for OSPFv3
- Juniper JunOS - added VXLAN support

### Breaking changes

- Table **Technology->Security->Object Groups** was dropped. All
  object groups are now part of the new security model. API calls to
  URL `/v1/tables/security/acl/object-groups` will no longer be
  working.

- For tables **Technology->Security->Access lists**
  (`/v1/tables/security/acl`) and **Zone Firewall**
  (`/v1/tables/security/zone-firewall/policies`), all columns except
  `name` were dropped
  (`seq`, `srcAddresses`, `dstAddresses`, `inAcl`, `outAcl`, `term`, `action`, `actionName` and `matches`
  for ACL table and
  `type`, `fromZone`, `toZone`, `seq`, `src`, `dst`, `appNames` and `actions` for
  Zone Firewall table) as new security model is represented by a tree.
  Because of that, it can't be fitted into a table format.

- Snapshot cannot be refreshed from the graph in this release. This
  function will come back in the following release 4.1.

- API for pathlookup has changed see [API Documentation](../../../../IP_Fabric_API/Path_Lookup/index.md)

### Improvements

#### The visualization part of the application was fully rewritten to boost performance and capabilities.

- The brand new UI
- Visualize your topology with a range of built-in layouts (or layout
  only selected nodes)
- Intent-based networking has never been easier, the results are shown
  in the context of visualized devices.
- Define your own preset, change color or labels for any protocol
- Use API to share visualizations with your wider ecosystem
- Highlight device neighbour relationship
- Share the view with your team
- Export to SVG, PNG
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Collapse or hide devices

#### The path lookup simulation was also completely rewritten to packet-based path-lookup simulation.

- The unicast simulation also supports subnets now
- Improved ACI topology simulation
- Added hairpin switching in different VLANs
- Multicast options for filtering receivers added
- Improved simulation through transit cloud including tunnelled
  traffic
- New packet inspector - understand all forwarding decisions at every
  layer
- Reworked security model - visualized in a tree
- Change path lookup edge colors according to packet header
  priorities

- Cisco ASA/FTD - added support for `show DNS` command and use it for
  translation of FQDNs in objects/ACLs

- Check Point Gaia - added support for Link Aggregation (Bond
  interfaces)

  that don't have introduced EoL data yet, data are grouped per vendor
  and add new column `Replacement`
- Routing edge improvement for tunnel interfaces with unnumbered IP
  addresses.
- Make LDAP group matching case insensitive.
- Inventory host table - hosts connected to ACI with default gateway
  on the non-ACI device have now edge switch.
- Pathlookup - ACI to FW connection added
- Table Management / Changes - added column `Snapshot name` for better
  orientation
- Tables - CSV Export - the format was changed and it's fully
  compliant with [RFC 4180](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180)
