# IP Fabric v6.4

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

### Upgrade Notices

- During the update process, locked snapshots will be unloaded together with other snapshots and their lock will be preserved. Therefore, such snapshots won't be deleted by snapshot retention.
- Upgrade to `6.4` may break custom SSO integrations and will require a change to the `/etc/ipf-dex.yaml` file. Since the `6.3.2` release, we are omitting minor API version for SSO configuration, and only major version will need to be changed with the next major IP Fabric version. Simply replace the `vX.Y` string in this file with `v6` and then run `systemctl restart ipf-dex`.

  ```yaml
  staticClients:
    - id: ipfabric
      redirectURIs:
        - "https://demo1.eu.ipfabric.io/api/vX/auth/external/azure"
  ```

  For more information, please refer to the [SSO documentation](../../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/sso.md#sso-configuration-ipf-dexyaml). If you would like assistance, please contact your Solution Architect.

### Experimental Features

Newly added features which need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team and we will gladly help you with enabling these features.

`SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`

: By default, IP Fabric excludes CLI jobs from the discovery process based
on already discovered devices and their local interface IP addresses. If
you have duplicate IP addresses in the network, then it can be worthy to
whitelist some subnets.

## v6.4.1

For the list of delivered tickets, please consult the [Low-Level Release Notes for 6.4.1](../../../release_notes_low-level/6.x/6.4.x/6.4.1.md).

### Bug Fixes

- Discovery process may get stuck when processing last devices in the queue. Also Remaining devices
  for the discovery are now being correctly removed from the queue.

## v6.4.0 (September 15th, 2023)

### GUI

- Added support for bulk actions on Vendor APIs (in both the global and
  snapshot-specific settings). This is useful for enabling, disabling or
  deleting all (or multiple) Vendor APIs at once.

### Network Discovery

- IP Fabric
  - When the discovery process is automatically stopped due to a discovery
    service being restarted multiple times, the resulting snapshot will be
    marked as `FAILED` (and it will contain a `The discovery process failed. Data in this snapshot is incomplete.` note).
  - Discovery services `tasker` and `worker` can now use 10GB of RAM instead of 6GB.
- Palo Alto
  - PAN-OS -- added support for SNMP (see our
    [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details)
- AWS
  - **Update the related IAM policy prior to upgrading to `6.4`.** Download the
    policy JSON file [IAM-policy-IPF_6.4.json](../../../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/aws/IAM-policy-IPF_6.4.json).
  - Transit Gateway routing significant update -- added support for connect,
    peering and direct-connect-gateway attachments. Improved support for VPC and
    VPN attachments.
  - Initial Direct Connect support -- Direct Connect Gateway with transit
    virtual interfaces only. E2E path-lookup over Direct Connect isn't fully
    supported yet.
- New source of information for identifying neighbours
  - We now support **ACI endpoint tables** as a possible source of information
    for identifying neighbours during the discovery process. You may add/remove
    the `ACI endpoints` entry in the `What information is used to identify neighbours` field in
    **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery Settings --> Discovery tasks settings**.
  - We only consider devices as neighbours if their OUIs are enabled for
    discovery in **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Global Configuration
    --> OUI**.

### Experimental Features

Newly added features which need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team and we will gladly help you with enabling these features.

- Cisco
  - ACI -- added basic support for **Service Graphs**
    - Service Graphs inventory added to
      [SDN](../../../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/SDN.md)
    - supported rules can be found in
      [Routing policies](../../../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/routing.md/#routing-policies)
