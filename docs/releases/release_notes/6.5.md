    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

## v6.5.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Network Discovery

- Check Point Gaia
  - Initial support for Identity Awareness (access-role objects) in security policies was added. See our [documentation](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md) about how to set up management servers.

  - Viptela -- to prevent long discovery time, limit for OMP route API endpoints
    was added. Default value is 100. (see our
    [documentation](../../../docs/support/known_issues/Vendors/cisco/Viptela_cEdge_omp_limit.md)
    for more details)

  - Only records retrieved from a particular operational command are shown. In
    previous versions, local interfaces addresses, which were generated by IP
    Fabric for diagram modeling, could be also visible.
- Stormshield
  - Basic discovery support was added as PoC and needs to be enabled manually. To enable it, please contact IP Fabric Support.
