# IP Fabric v6.5

!!! danger "Unreleased version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

## v6.5.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Important product changes

#### Forcing `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0`

All secure (read "encrypted with OpenSSL") connections made by IP Fabric have
forced `DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=0` to allow connections to devices with older OpenSSL
versions (which leads to the use of ciphers that are now considered weak). This
is just a temporary solution and will be removed in the future. We are working
on a solution to allow OpenSSL being configured by the user from the outside of
the `node.js` process.

### Network Discovery

- Check Point Gaia
  - Initial support for Identity Awareness (access-role objects) in security
    policies was added. See our
    [documentation](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md) about how
    to set up management servers.
- Cisco
  - Viptela -- to prevent long discovery time, limit for OMP route API endpoints
    was added. Default value is 100. (see our
    [documentation](../../../docs/support/known_issues/Vendors/cisco/Viptela_cEdge_omp_limit.md)
    for more details)
- ARP Table
  - Only records retrieved from a particular operational command are shown. In
    previous versions, local interfaces addresses, which were generated by IP
    Fabric for diagram modeling, could be also visible.
- Stormshield
  - Basic discovery support was added as PoC and needs to be enabled manually.
    To enable it, please contact IP Fabric Support.
- Google Cloud Platform
  - Basic discovery support was added, still under development as firewall and
    NAT feature is not finished yet. Only VPC, cloud routers, subnets, routes,
    and instances are discovered. Might be problematic in E2E discovery. To
    enable it, please contact IP Fabric Support.
- F5 BIG-IP
  - End-to-End Path Lookup support was added for F5. Now you can see paths after
    load-balancing action to exact pool members.
- Advanced settings for Vendor APIs
  - It is now possible to fine-tune maximum concurrent requests, `maxCapacity`,
    and `refillRate` for each Vendor API. For more details, see
    [Vendors API - Advanced settings](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API.md#advanced-settings).
