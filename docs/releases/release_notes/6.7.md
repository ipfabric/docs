# IP Fabric v6.7

!!! danger "Unreleased version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

## v6.7.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Replacement of `nimpee startprod` and `nimpee stopprod` commands

- The `nimpee` script (`sys-nimpee.sh`) used to manage the IP Fabric services
  has been replaced with the `ipf-appliance` service group. You can use:
  - `systemctl start ipf-appliance` instead of `nimpee startprod`
  - `systemctl stop ipf-appliance` instead of `nimpee stoppprod`
- We want to leverage system tooling instead of custom scripts.

### Important Product Changes

- Cisco FMC client re-sends `GET` request once when it receives `200 OK` response with empty body.

#### Breaking Change in Intent Verification Checks

Inconsistent behavior has been identified in the comparison of empty values in number columns between table data and intent verification checks. Empty values are now treated as the smallest possible value when compared to any number, both in tables and in intent verification checks.

### Network Discovery

- Cisco
  - Viptela -- Added support for [Service Chaining](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/cisco-sd-wan-service-chaining). Service chaining policies are modeled in PBR task. Other PBR Viptela functionality isn't supported.

### Other Minor Changes

- MAC addresses starting with `649EF3` are no longer incorrectly detected as IP Phones but as network devices.
