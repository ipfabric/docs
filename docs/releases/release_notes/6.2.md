# IP Fabric v6.2 (Hessian)

!!! danger "Unreleased version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and is not available for download.

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

## v6.2.0 (TBD)

### Backward incompatible changes

- Tables for Cisco APIC (endpoint group contracts, applications, bridge domains and controllers) have `siteName` and `hostname` columns replaced by `apiUrl` string column.

### Noticeable changes

- Limiting the number of the Discovery services restarts -- only 1 restart per service is allowed (previously unlimited). Crashed service will impact the IP Fabric ability to finish running discovery or start a new one. Investigation of the cause of the restart is advised.

### Network Discovery

- Alcatel -- Added support for basic network management (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- Cisco
  - FMC -- Added support for HA Pairs in Zone Firewall.
  - FMC -- Added support for EtherChannels in Zone Firewall.
- Forcepoint -- NAT support was added (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- FS -- Added limited support of basic discovery (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- PaloAlto
  - Panos -- Added support for license (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
  - Prisma -- Added support for management tasks (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).

### Underlying Operating System and 3rd party packages

- The `dex` package used for SSO was upgraded from version 2.30.2 to latest version 2.36.0, see [their release notes](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases).
- Added several tools to simplify image management and troubleshooting. We are explicitly including the following -- `dnsutils`, `htop`, `ldap-utils`, `lftp`, `libcap2-bin`, `lsof`, `mtr-tiny`, `nano`, `net-tools`, `ncdu`, `screen`, `sntp`, `strace`, `tcpd`, `tcpdump`, `telnet`, `tmux`, `traceroute`, `vim`, `wget`.

### Upgrade Notices

- Upgrade to `v6.2` will break custom SSO integrations and will require a change to the `/etc/ipf-dex.yaml` file. Simply replace the `vX.Y` in this file with `v6.2` and then run `systemctl restart ipf-dex`.

  ```yaml
  staticClients:
  - id: ipfabric
    redirectURIs:
        - 'https://demo1.eu.ipfabric.io/api/vX.Y/auth/external/azure'
  ```
