# IP Fabric v7.9

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

!!! Info "Version 7.8 Notice"

    IP Fabric `7.9` follows directly after `7.5`. Version `7.8` was made available but not broadly promoted or delivered via online updates.

    The `7.8` release notes are included [here](7.8.md) for reference, as its changes were incorporated into later releases.

## Known Issues

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

- Using separate Vendor API configurations to discover the Shared VPC host and service projects leads to inconsistent results. This will be fixed in a future release.
  More details regarding the issue can be seen [here](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/gcp.md).

## v7.9.1 (UNRELEASED)

### Improvements

#### Performance

Fixed a performance regression that caused path lookup queries to return results significantly slower in `7.8` compared to `7.3`.

#### Configurable Memory Limits for API & Discovery Services

Memory limits for API and discovery services are now configurable and no longer fixed. This gives better control over resource usage and makes it easier to tune the system for different environments.

The configured memory limits are logged and visible in the UI, providing better transparency during discoveries.

If you encounter out-of-memory issues or need to **adjust memory limits** for your deployment, please contact IP Fabric Customer Support for guidance.

#### Technology Tables

##### New Tables

- **Cloud Serverless Services** table under vendor-specific table
  [**Technology → Cloud → Vendors → GCP → Serverless Services**](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/cloud/vendors.md)
  covering **App Engine**, **Cloud Function**, and **Cloud Run**.
- **Virtual Servers** - **Path Rules** table under Load Balancing [**Technology → Load-balancing**](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/load_balancing.md#virtual-servers-path-rules).
- **DNS** table under [**Technology → Cloud → Vendors → Azure**](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/cloud/vendors.md#azure).

#### Path Lookup

Path Lookup has been extended to support IPv6 for both Unicast and Host to Gateway scenarios. The following technologies are now supported for IPv6 path analysis:
routing, security evaluation, 6in4, GRE, and IPsec.

!!! warning "Limitations"

    NAT and PBR are not yet supported for IPv6 lookups.

Path Lookup has been extended to support Layer 3 routing between cloud-only devices with no interface names.

#### Vendor Support

- **Check Point Gaia** -- Improved NTP data collection by supporting the extended `ntpq` command, providing detailed NTP source information. For more details, see [Extend command to get better NTP results](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md#extend-command-to-get-better-ntp-results).
- **GCP** -- Added support for VPC Network Peering configured between VPC networks in different Google Cloud projects.
- **Azure** -- Improved security evaluation for Azure Firewall.

#### Enhanced Password Security

Password validation has been strengthened in both the UI and API.
Passwords must be 8–200 characters long and include at least 3 of 5 character categories
(uppercase, lowercase, numerals, special ASCII, Unicode alphabetic).
More details on [Authentication page](../../IP_Fabric_API/authentication.md#password-requirements).

### Experimental Features

#### Dedicated API Discovery Worker

An experimental dedicated worker for API-based discovery is available. When enabled, it improves scalability and discovery performance for **API-only devices** by running API discovery independently from other discovery processes.

Discovery behavior and results remain unchanged. The solution includes built-in protections to respect vendor API rate limits and is designed to scale independently.

This feature is **disabled by default**. Customers interested in evaluating it can **contact IP Fabric Customer Support** for more information and assistance with enabling it.
