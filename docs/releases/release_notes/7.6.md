--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

## Known Issues

There are currently no known issues in IP Fabric version 7.6.

## v7.6.1 (October 27th, 2025, Private Release)

### Potential Race Conditions and File Conflicts During Upgrade

A race condition in the appliance upgrade process could cause misleading error messages during upgrades.
We also fixed cases where upgrades could fail due to configuration files that had been incorrectly created or modified in the past.
Both issues are now resolved and should no longer occur.

### Removal of ArangoDB

ArangoDB has been completely removed in this release, including all related dependencies and custom configuration options.

### New Features

#### System upgrade via CLI

A new command-line tool `/opt/ipf-system-upgrade/bin/cli` now enables performing system upgrades in the same way as through the web interface.

### Improvements

#### API logging

The `ipf-api` component now writes logs to `/var/log/ipf/ipf-api/` instead of forwarding them to syslog.

#### Improved PostgreSQL Migration Process

We have addressed edge cases where PostgreSQL might not have been configured correctly during upgrades.
Additional checks and safeguards now ensure consistent and reliable system configuration.
The installation process has also been improved to better handle dependencies between the product and PostgreSQL.

#### Simplified TechSupport Exports

Logs from cloud-init are now excluded from TechSupport exports.

#### Additional Disk-space Checks During Upgrade

Added a pre-upgrade check for available disk space to prevent the appliance from running out of space during an upgrade.

#### Jumphost Logs Included in TechSupport Exports

The `ipf-jumphost` service, which has logged to `/var/log/ipf/ipf-jumphost/` since release 7.0 to keep its logs separate from system logs, now includes
these logs in TechSupport exports to assist with troubleshooting.
