!!! warning "Read All Upgrade Notices"

    Please read all UPGRADE NOTICES, WARNINGS, and IMPORTANT messages prior to beginning installation.
    This upgrade requires IP Fabric to be on `v4.4.3` prior to upgrading to `v5.0.0`.

!!! warning "API Versioning"

    API versioning has been introduced in v5.0.0. API endpoint URLs will now
    contain `api/v5.0` rather than `api/v1`. If you are scripting against the
    API or using it to integrate into other systems, you must change the URL to
    the new format. For more information on this please visit the [API
    Documentation](../../IP_Fabric_API/index.md) page.

    `ipfabric` and `ipfabric-diagrams` Python SDK's have been updated to
    support the new changes. Please visit
    [python-ipfabric](https://pypi.org/project/ipfabric/) and
    [python-ipfabric-diagrams](https://pypi.org/project/ipfabric-diagrams/)
    for more information.

!!! warning "SSO and API versioning"

    Upgrade to `v5.0.0` will break custom SSO integrations an will require
    changes to your files prior to re-enabling. Before upgrading and if you have
    SSO deployed please contact your Solution Architect to copy your custom
    settings and and re-deploy them after the update.

!!! warning "Input validation"

    String input validation has been improved in features such as FTP/SFTP
    backup, Jumphost, SNMP, and certificate settings and will only accept the
    following characters: `A-Za-z0-9.,/-_@%^:=+ -`.

    Previously set strings may no longer work. For example, an SNMP community
    string previously set with an invalid character (i.e. `IPFabric&123`) would
    cause SNMP queries not to work until the string is updated with only valid
    characters

!!! important "RBAC phase 1"

    The first phase of a new implementation of Role-Based Access Control is
    included in `5.0.0`. There is a known caveat where generation of API tokens
    does not take into account the new RBAC roles â€“ this will be remedied in
    `5.0.0`. If you are planning on using Roles and API Tokens it is
    recommended to wait for the fix before assigning any user to the custom
    roles. If a user is in a custom Role they will not be able to create an API
    token until the next patch release.

!!! important "Extreme Family Rename"

    Extreme `XOS` family has been correctly renamed to `EXOS`.

!!! important "IPv6 Support"

    IPv6 support has been significantly enhanced in `5.0.0` with new tables and
    a new underlying network model. As a result, IPv6 data in older snapshots
    may not display correctly in `5.0.0`. We have made all efforts possible to
    migrate data between versions, but if you do have issues in `5.0.0`, please
    run a new snapshot and check the data again. Please raise a support ticket
    if you still experience problems.

!!! important "Path Lookup API Change"

    A new required parameter `enableRegions` has been added to the Path Lookup API for Unicast and Multicast.
    If set to `false` it will ignore the values in the `srcRegions` and `dstRegions` parameters.

    `enableRegions [mandatory] - boolean - (default false)`

### **UPGRADE NOTICES**

- This upgrade requires IP Fabric to be on `v4.4.3` prior to upgrade to `v5.0.0`. IP Fabric `v4.4.2` or lower will not work -- please upgrade to `4.4.3` using the normal method before carrying out the `5.0.0` upgrade process.
- Due to the major changes stated above, automatic updates will be disabled for this release and will require manual upgrade.
- Prior to update please ensure you perform a [backup of your system](../../System_Administration/Administrative_Interface/backup_and_restore.md) or it is highly recommend to create a VM snapshot
- It is recommended (for all updates) to unload all snapshots prior to performing the upgrade.
- Requires 10GB of free disk space.
- Estimated upgrade time is around 20 minutes however depending on the resources of your VM it could take longer than an hour.
- During update to `5.0.0` no message about the update being finished is shown and a refresh of the Admin page is required to check if the API and services are back online.
- After approximately 5-10 minutes after the update file has finished uploading to the server you should be able to log into the IPF CLI as `osadmin` and run the following command to track installation progress
  - `tail -f /var/log/nimpee/dist_upgrade.log`
  - If `tail` command is not found wait a few minutes and log out and back into the CLI.
- Once upgrade has finished the system will reboot (see below the example output of the `dist_upgrade.log` file).
- After all updates, please [**Clear Browser Cache**](../index.md).
- Not all new features will be available until a new snapshot is created on the updated version.
- If after the upgrade you experience issues with `AQL: internal error`, Dashboards, or Topology please first try restarting the `ArangoDB` service from the System Administrator page prior to contacting support.
  - Log into the System Administrator Page located or port `443`
  - In the `System Status` page under `System Services` you will find `ArangoDB`
  - Next to the status color is a `restart` button which will restart the service
- If you run into any other issues during or after the upgrade please open a [support ticket](http://support.ipfabric.io/).

Example output of successful `/var/log/nimpee/dist_upgrade.log` log file:

```bash
osadmin@ipfabric:~$ tail -f /var/log/nimpee/dist_upgrade.log
+ echo --- exit_code: 0, cleaning up ---
--- exit_code: 0, cleaning up ---

### Role-Based Access Control Phase 1

IP Fabric `v5.0.0` includes Phase 1 of RBAC. The most significant change is that Users are now assigned to a Role(s) and not given specific permissions. During the upgrade process your users will be migrated to the appropriate roles. For more information see the documentation at the links below.

- [Policies](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/policies.md)
  - This is where you define the endpoints users have access to.
  - There are 5 built-in Policies in `v5.0.0`
    - `settings`: Access to snapshot and product settings endpoints
    - `discovery`: Access to discovery endpoints
    - `team`: Access to user management endpoints
    - `tables`: Access to table endpoints
    - `others`: Migrated read scope - to be deprecated in 5.1
- [Roles](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/roles.md)
  - A Role can consist of one or more policies
  - `admin` role cannot be changed or deleted
- [Users](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/users.md)
  - A User can also consist of one or more roles

### IP Fabric VM OS-Level Changes

- The OS has been updated to Debian 11 "bullseye"
  - `openvpn` version has been updated to `2.5.1`
    - This version drops older ciphers, and could have an impact on users utilizing those ciphers
  - `sshuttle` version has been updated to `1.0.5`
    - This upgrade could potentially impact jumphost connectivity
- removed jailkit for `osadmin` user
  - There is still the limitation for changing the `osadmin` account password only via running `nimpee-net-config -t`
  - CLI users logging in as `osadmin` now have `sudo` access

--8<-- "snippets/cli_root_access.md"

- All TLS version less than `v1.3` have been deprecated.
  - Some older browsers, proxies, or systems may have issues connecting to IP Fabric after this change.
  - To re-enable an older version please see [Custom TLS Settings](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Custom_TLS.md) or contact your Solution Architect.
- Boot Wizard Changes
  - For VM initial deployments where console access is not possible, it's now possible to run the boot wizard via SSH
    - Boot the VM, determine the IP address assigned to it from DHCP, and SSH to the VM: `ssh osadmin@<dhcp-learned-ip-address>`
    - Once logged in, run `nimpee-net-config -a`
- [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/) preliminary support
  - For users wanting to automate VM installations, `cloud-init` can be used for initial VM provisioning
  - IP address assignment to the VM is supported via `cloud-init`
  - Any other changes via `cloud-init` (users, ssh keys, resizing) may work, but are untested and unsupported
  - Changing the password for `osadmin` through `cloud-init` is discouraged as it has some implications, use `nimpee-net-config -t` instead
  - If you are using auto `cloud-init` via certain cloud providers, note the OpenSSH server will regenerate new public/private keys
- Added `qemu-guest-agent` for easier monitoring in environments such as OpenStack
- Entry input validation has been improved in features such as backup, jumphosts, SNMP and certificates
  - Strings should only accept the following characters: `A-Za-z0-9.,/-_@%^:=+ -`
  - Previously set strings may no longer work. For example, an SNMP community string previously set with an invalid character (i.e. `IPFabric&123`) would cause SNMP queries not to work until the string is updated with only valid characters
