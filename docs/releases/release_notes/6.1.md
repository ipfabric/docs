## v6.1.0 (TBD)

### Noticeable changes

- Removed the End User Licensing agreement (EULA) acceptance step on a user's first log-in. A user approves EULA on loading a license.
- Web front-end migrated from local storage to cookie-based storage for access and refresh tokens.
- Vendor API configuration now has two additional fields -- `slug` (**required**) and `comment` (optional). See the [API section](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/Vendors_API/index.md#slug-and-comment) for more information.
  - During the upgrade the required field `slug` will be auto-generated for all current configured API providers.
- Clearing the database while keeping application settings no longer removes API tokens from the database.
- SSO configuration now allows for the use of `roleName` in the `/opt/nimpee/conf.d/api.json` file. Please see [Single Sign On (SSO)](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/user_management/sso.md).
  - It is recommended to migrate from `roleId` to `roleName` for consistency and human readability.
- During the upgrade, all snapshots -- including locked snapshots -- will be unloaded. Once the upgrade is completed, please load an existing snapshot, or perform a new discovery to populate network data in IP Fabric.

### Network Discovery

- Palo Alto Prisma -- Added support of basic discovery (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- AWS -- The IAM policy has been updated. There are 2 more endpoints required for the discovery of AWS infrastructure. See the [Amazon Web Services](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/Vendors_API/AWS_Amazon_Web_Services.md) page.
- Brocade -- Added support for stack.
- Alcatel -- Added support of basic discovery (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- Policy Based Routing (PBR) -- Added support for PBR on Cisco (IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS), FortiGate (Fortinet) and HP (Comware) devices. See [Routing](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/Technology_Tables/Routing.md) page
- HP Comware -- Added support for route-policies and routing protocols filter-policies. There is a known issue in case route-policy and policy-based-route have the same name, only policy-based-route will be visible in route-maps table.

### Upgrade Notices

- Forcepoint -- More features supported, mainly added support for SMC API (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
