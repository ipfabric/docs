### Noticeable changes

- Removed the End User Licensing agreement (EULA) acceptance step on a user's first log-in. A user approves EULA on loading a license.
- Web front-end migrated from local storage to cookie-based storage for access and refresh tokens.
- Vendor API configuration now has two additional fields -- `slug` (**required**) and `comment` (optional). See the [API section](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/Vendors_API/index.md#slug-and-comment) for more information.
  - During the upgrade the required field `slug` will be auto-generated for all current configured API providers.
- Clearing the database while keeping application settings no longer removes API tokens from the database.
- SSO configuration now allows for the use of `roleName` in the `/opt/nimpee/conf.d/api.json` file. Please see [Single Sign On (SSO)](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/user_management/sso.md).
  - It is recommended to migrate from `roleId` to `roleName` for consistency and human readability.
- During the upgrade, all snapshots -- including locked snapshots -- will be unloaded. Once the upgrade is completed, please load an existing snapshot, or perform a new discovery to populate network data in IP Fabric.
- String table columns now support case insensitive regular expression operator and its negation.
- Added a column to show if Checkpoint rules are active.
- Removed "Technology > Spanning Tree > STP Stability" table from frontend and marked API endpoint `/tables/spanning-tree/topology` deprecated.
  "STP instances" table can be used instead.
- Clarified [password requirements and complexity checks](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/change_osadmin_pass.md) for the `osadmin` user.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved an issue with Checkpoint rules displaying incorrect values for rule names and remarks.
- Resolved an issue where entries are not being created for hosts when there is a routing table entry for the specific host address.
- Resolved an issue where table privileges for non-admin users were not interpreted correctly in graphs. Non-admin users with table privileges are now able to see graphs correctly.
- Resolved an issue where traffic shaper configured over 90Mbps incorrectly shows 3Mbps after reboot.

### Network Discovery

- Alcatel -- Added support of basic discovery (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- Arista -- Updated EoL information.
- AWS -- The IAM policy has been updated. There are 2 more endpoints required for the discovery of AWS infrastructure. See the [Amazon Web Services](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/Vendors_API/AWS_Amazon_Web_Services.md) page.
