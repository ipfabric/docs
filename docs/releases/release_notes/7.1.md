### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- A large number of various parsing and mapping fixes have been made. For details about these fixes, please check the Low-Level Release Notes.

### Known Issues

#### Inconsistent Color-Coding
- The **Inventory --> OS Versions** view (`/inventory/os-versions/platforms` and `/inventory/os-versions/models`)
may display inconsistent color-coding in tables where empty rows appear for the default intent-checks.
This visual inconsistency does not impact functionality, but it may affect readability.
- Issue will be resolved in version `7.2`.
