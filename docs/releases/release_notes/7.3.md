### Known Issues

#### Configuration Management Process Fails to Close SSH Sessions

On HPE `arubasw` family devices, the Configuration Management process sometimes fails to terminate SSH connections properly. This occurs when a login banner isn't detected, causing SSH sessions to remain open indefinitely.

To verify if this is happening, access your IP Fabric appliance's command line interface and execute the following when the Configuration Management process is not running:

``` bash
netstat -tnpa | grep 'ESTABLISHED' | grep syslogWorkerBu | grep :22
```

If you see persistent SSH connections, the output will display multiple active sessions like this:

``` bash
root@ipfabric:~# netstat -tnpa | grep 'ESTABLISHED' | grep syslogWorkerBu | grep :22
tcp        0      0 10.0.192.108:52784      10.20.94.22:22          ESTABLISHED 624/syslogWorkerBui
tcp        0      0 10.0.192.108:22184      10.20.88.20:22          ESTABLISHED 624/syslogWorkerBui
tcp        0      0 10.0.192.108:27698      10.20.130.21:22         ESTABLISHED 624/syslogWorkerBui
tcp        0      0 10.0.192.108:30666      10.20.94.24:22          ESTABLISHED 624/syslogWorkerBui
```

To resolve this, restart the Configuration Management service with command:

```
systemctl restart ipf-discovery-syslogworker.service
```

### New Features

#### IPv6 Discovery Support

Extended network discovery capabilities to support IPv6 networks alongside IPv4, ensuring all existing IPv4 functionality remains unaffected.

##### Backward Compatibility

- Existing IPv4 discovery workflows continue to function as expected.
- No changes are required for IPv4-only setups.

##### API Enhancements

- The `/settings` API now accepts and processes **IPv6 addresses** in:
  - Seed lists
  - Include/Exclude/Whitelist networks
  - Device credentials
  - Custom SSH/Telnet ports
- Address-type validation ensures that:
  - IPv4 filters apply only to IPv4 addresses
  - IPv6 filters apply only to IPv6 addresses

##### Discovery Configuration Updates

- Introduced a new task type: `NDPv6`, available under **Global Discovery Tasks** settings.
- IPv6 networks can now be discovered using a combination of:
  - Seed addresses
  - Include/Exclude/Whitelist networks
  - Device credentials

!!! warning "Login IP Deprecation"

    The Login IP (`loginIp`) column is being deprecated and replaced with `loginIpv4` and `loginIpv6`.
    Please ensure all scripts, automations, or reports are properly updated to reflect this change.

##### Deprecated  Tables

<!-- WE DO NOT REMOVE TABLES OUTSIDE MAJOR RELEASES FIXME -->

- Removed tables of already deprecated API endpoints:
  - `Managed Networks`
  - `Gateway Redundancy`

!!! info "IPv4 Managed IP Summary table"

    As of version `7.0`, the Managed Networks and Gateway Redundancy tables have been replaced by the [IPv4 Managed IP Summary table](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/addressing/ipv4-managed-ip-summary.md).

#### GUI

IP Input Enhancement:

- **Search Functionality**: Users can perform keyword-based searches within the IP list to quickly locate specific entries.
- **IP List Management**: Users can efficiently manage IP addresses through enhanced multi-selection capabilities. Multiple IPs can be selected via:
  - `Shift + Left Click` to select range.
  - `Click-and-Drag`, similar to text selection in a paragraph. 
  - Once selected, IP addresses can be copied or removed from the list.

#### Layout Optimization for Large Circular Graphs

In release `7.2`, we added an autonomous optimization switch from circular to universal layout for graphs with more than 100 nodes. This functionality
is now fully supported at the API level and is also fully integrated into the UI starting with this release.

#### Configuration Management

- Simplified configuration selection for comparison.
- Added a new `Compare with previous version` button to configuration entries in the table.

#### Network Discovery

- **New Device -- AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
  - Initial support for data collection & inventory. The path lookup via ALB is not supported yet.

- **New Device -- Azure ExpressRoute Circuit (ERC)**
  - Data collection and end-to-end path lookup via ERC is now supported. The path lookup via ERC when deployed in vWAN is not supported yet.

- **New Device -- Azure RouteServer (ARS)**
  - Initial support for data collection & inventory - end-to-end path lookup via Network Virtual Appliances has been improved.

- **New Capabilities -- Arista**
  - Support for route-maps has been added.

- **New Capabilities -- CheckPoint, Juniper**
  - Support for URL filtering has been added.

- **New Capabilities -- PaloAlto (PAN-OS)**
  - Support for IP and PREDEFINED-IP type objects of `External Dynamic List` [has been added](#palo-alto-external-dynamic-lists).

- **New Device -- Meraki Cloud-managed Catalyst Switches**
  - Now discoverable via the Meraki API  
  - Identification: Firmware prefix `CS` and Monitoring Version `n/a`  
  - Discovery can be disabled via [feature flags](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md).

#### Path Lookup

- Using Palo Alto's `External Dynamic List` in combination with end-to-end path lookup:
  - To investigate a Path Lookup scenario for a specific IP expected to be in the dynamic list, use the `Source / Destination IP fields` and enter the IP address.
  - If the content of the dynamic list is not available, or if you need to find where a specific list is being used, use the `Source / Destination Region fields`
and enter the name of the list as it appears in the configuration.

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- Interface uptime/downtime is now available for **Arista** located in the new `Last Status Change` (`lastStatusChange`) column in the **Inventory** > **Interfaces** table.
- Switch priority is now available for **Cisco** **StackWise** located in the new `Switch Priority` (`switchPriority`) **Technology** --> **Platforms** --> **Cisco VSS** --> **Chassis** table.

#### Advanced Filters

- **Device Attribute-Based Advanced Filters**
now support **Uptime** as a device property.
- For a complete list of properties and supported tables, refer to [Technology Tables -- Device-Based Advanced Filters](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#device-based-advanced-filters).

### Experimental Features

Newly added features which need to be explicitly enabled in service files. You can enable these yourself using our [feature documentation](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md) or if you are not comfortable self-enabling these features or need further clarification, contact our Support or Solution Architect team. We will gladly help you.


#### Cisco ACI Service Graphs Improvements

The path lookup capability for Layer 2 (L2) has been added to Cisco ACI Service Graphs.

To collect Service Graph data, the feature flag `ENABLE_ACI_SERVICEGRAPHS_ENDPOINTS` must be enabled. For more information, see [feature flag documentation](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#aci-service-graphs).

#### Palo Alto External Dynamic Lists

The ingestion of Palo Alto's External Dynamic Lists for URL Filtering and IP Lists is currently available as an experimental feature.

To access this functionality, respective [feature flags](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#palo-alto-external-dynamic-lists) must be enabled. (`ENABLE_PALOALTO_EDL_IPLIST` and `ENABLE_PALOALTO_EDL_URLLIST`).

#### Transparent Firewalls

Initial support for **transparent firewalls** has been introduced. Since transparent firewalls typically operate at Layer 2 and remain **invisible to other network devices**,
manual link configuration is required to incorporate them into the network model.

To enable this feature, the corresponding [feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#enable-manual-links-transparent-firewall) (`ENABLE_MANUAL_LINKS`) must be activated.

Once enabled, transparent firewalls will appear in the **graph topology**, and **basic path lookup** (excluding security policy evaluation) will be supported.
