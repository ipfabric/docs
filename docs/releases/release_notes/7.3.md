#### Path Lookup

- Using Palo Alto's `External Dynamic List` in combination with end to end path lookup:
  - To investigate a Path Lookup scenario for a specific IP expected to be in the dynamic list, use the `Source / Destination IP fields` and enter the IP address.
  - If the content of the dynamic list is not available, or if you need to find where a specific list is being used, use the `Source / Destination Region fields`
and enter the name of the list as it appears in the configuration.

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- Interface uptime/downtime is now available for **Arista**.
- Switch priority is now available for **Cisco** **StackWise**.
- Downloading the content of the `External Dynamic List` object for **Palo Alto**'s URL Filtering and IP List must be
[enabled manually via a feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#velocloud-discovery) (`ENABLE_PALOALTO_EDL_IPLIST`, `ENABLE_PALOALTO_EDL_URLLIST`).

#### Advanced Filters

now support **Uptime** as a device property.
