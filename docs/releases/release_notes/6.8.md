# IP Fabric v6.8

!!! danger "Unreleased version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

## v6.8.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Network Discovery

- Silver Peak (HPE Aruba EdgeConnect) -- Stale ARP records are stored due to a
  very short expiration time (TTL).
- Versa -- Previously, Versa devices were discovered only via the API. Now you
  can enable hybrid discovery (combining API calls and CLI commands). See
  [Cisco Viptela SD-WAN](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Cisco_Viptela_SD-WAN.md##cisco-viptela-sd-wan).
- Viptela -- Previously, Viptela devices were discovered only via the API. Now
  you can enable hybrid discovery (combining API calls and CLI commands). See
  [Versa Networks SD-WAN](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Versa_Networks_SD-WAN.md).
- HPE Citrix Aruba CX -- Support for Policy-Based Routing was added.

### Other Changes

- Discovery error detection and reporting have been improved.
- `Device Change` dashboard widget -- The `Number of Changes` axis' scale has
  been changed from linear to logarithmic. This adjustment should improve
  visualization overall and prevent confusion with scale in certain cases.
