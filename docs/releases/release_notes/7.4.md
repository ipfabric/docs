## `v7.4.0` (UNRELEASED)

### Improvements

#### GUI

- File names of exported graphs were improved. Instead of naming all files `graph`, the file name
  now consists of basic view information (saved view name, site name or path lookup IPs) and a timestamp.
- The attribute filter in the header now displays attributes and values from all loaded snapshots, clearly
  marking those that are not present in the currently selected snapshot. This change eliminates various glitches
  when a different snapshot is selected while having the attribute filter active.

#### Network Discovery

### Other Changes

- Removed feature flag `ENABLE_ACI_FVTENANT`
