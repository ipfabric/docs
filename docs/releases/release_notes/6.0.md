### Changes to IP Fabric Appliance config wizard

- Starting in 6.0, when setting the hostname in the config wizard, the hostname will follow [RFC1035 Section 2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-2.3.1) standards.

  ```bnf
  <domain> ::= <subdomain> | " "
  <subdomain> ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>
  <label> ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]
  <ldh-str> ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>
  <let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"
  <let-dig> ::= <letter> | <digit>
  <letter> ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in upper case and a through z in lower case
  <digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9
  ```

### Network Discovery

- Parallel command loading has been implemented for Cisco Meraki. This will significantly speed up discovery.
- VMware NSX-T -- Added support for E2E PathLookup with evaluation of DFW and Gateway Firewall Policies.
- Forcepoint NGFW -- Added support of basic discovery in firewall/vpn mode (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- Cisco -- Added support for collecting FabricPath data.
- Discovery bandwidth limit can be set up to 100Mb/s in UI.
- The number of discovery workers running in parallel can be tuned, please contact the IP Fabric support team.
- Cisco ASA, IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS -- Added support for route maps and prefix-lists (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Hostname parsing was improved, domain parsing was added (when applicable).
- On Palo Alto firewall new hostname format is used -- `hostname/vsysName` instead of `hostname/vsysId`.
- Logical Devices -- Added a summary table of all discovered logical firewalls (contexts, vsys, VDOM) and Cisco Nexus VDCs.
- AWS -- it is now possible to set multiple regions and assume roles in one configuration.
- Huawei -- New OS version parsing. We now show more Huawei like OS versioning e.g. `V800R021C00SPC100` instead of `8.210`.

### Logging

- JSON log files for all discovery services. Please note that these files can be several times (about 6x) larger than existing logs.

### EULA

- Updated End User Licensing agreement (EULA). Current users may be asked to resign any existing EULA.
