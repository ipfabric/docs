### Attributes

You can now configure custom attributes for devices, this can be found under `Settings` --> `Device Attributes`.

### RBAC

You can now specify the level of access a user has by restricting the ability to use certain API Endpoints, or you can restrict which devices the user has access to via Device Attributes. New settings can be find under:

- `Settings` --> `User Management` --> `Polices`
- `Settings` --> `User Management` --> `Roles`

### Assurance Engine

- Assurance Engine is a new tab found under global and snapshot settings.
- Users can now disable specific tasks to speed up discovery. You can toggle the following features from the Assurance Engine:
  - Loading Graph Cache
  - Save Historical Data
  - Compute Intent Verification Rules

### Changes to IP Fabric Appliance config wizard

- Starting in 6.0, when setting the hostname in the config wizard, the hostname will follow [RFC1035 Section 2.3.1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035#section-2.3.1) standards.

  ```bnf
  <domain> ::= <subdomain> | " "
  <subdomain> ::= <label> | <subdomain> "." <label>
  <label> ::= <letter> [ [ <ldh-str> ] <let-dig> ]
  <ldh-str> ::= <let-dig-hyp> | <let-dig-hyp> <ldh-str>
  <let-dig-hyp> ::= <let-dig> | "-"
  <let-dig> ::= <letter> | <digit>
  <letter> ::= any one of the 52 alphabetic characters A through Z in upper case and a through z in lower case
  <digit> ::= any one of the ten digits 0 through 9
  ```

### Network Discovery

- Parallel command loading has been implemented for Cisco Meraki. This will significantly speed up discovery.
- VMware NSX-T -- Added support for E2E PathLookup with evaluation of DFW and Gateway Firewall Policies.
- Forcepoint NGFW -- Added support of basic discovery in firewall/vpn mode (see our [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details).
- Cisco -- Added support for collecting FabricPath data.
- Discovery bandwidth limit can be set up to 100Mb/s in UI.
- The number of discovery workers running in parallel can be tuned, please contact the IP Fabric support team for guidance.
- Cisco ASA, IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS -- Added support for route maps and prefix-lists (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Hostname parsing was improved, domain parsing was added (when applicable).
- On Palo Alto firewall new hostname format is used -- `hostname/vsysName` instead of `hostname/vsysId`.
- Logical Devices -- Added a summary table of all discovered logical firewalls (contexts, VSYS, VDOM) and Cisco Nexus VDCs.
- AWS -- it is now possible to set multiple regions and [AssumeRoles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_AssumeRole.html) in one configuration.
- Huawei -- New OS version parsing. We now show more Huawei like OS versioning e.g. `V800R021C00SPC100` instead of `8.210`.

### Logging

- JSON log files for all discovery services. Please note that these files can be several times (about 6x) larger than existing logs.

### EULA

- Updated the End User Licensing agreement (EULA). Current users may be asked to resign any existing EULA.
