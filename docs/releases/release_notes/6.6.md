### Important product changes

- API-discovered devices are now available in the global Device Attributes settings via Serial number search autocomplete.
- A request to `POST /discovery/trigger-config-backup` now will return `403 Forbidden` instead of `404 Not Found` if an API-discovered device `sn` is provided as parameter. 
- API worker maximum memory usage is now limited to 8GB (instead of 4GB) to minimize possibility out of memory crash because of heavy calculations operations.
- Cisco FMC API client can detect refresh token expiration and re-authenticate when it happens.

### Known issues

#### State refresh issues in `Discovery Snapshot` section with webhook enabled

When a webhook is configured and enabled in **Settings --> Integration -->
Webhooks**, a newly started discovery won't show progress until you switch to
another menu section (for example **Dashboard**) and back to **Discovery
Snapshot** (or until you refresh the page).

| With webhook -- incorrect behavior | Without webhook -- correct behavior |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| ![Incorrect](6.6_with_webhook.gif) | ![Correct](6.6_without_webhook.gif) |

You may also encounter that after deleting a snapshot, it is still being shown
among `Loaded/Unloaded Snapshots` until you switch to another menu section and
back (or until you refresh the page).
