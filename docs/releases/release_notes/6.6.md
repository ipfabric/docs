### Important Product Changes

- API-discovered devices are now available in the global Device Attributes settings via Serial number search autocomplete.
- A request to `POST /discovery/trigger-config-backup` now will return `403 Forbidden` instead of `404 Not Found` if an API-discovered device `sn` is provided as parameter. 
- API worker maximum memory usage is now limited to 8GB (instead of 4GB) to minimize possibility out of memory crash because of heavy calculations operations.
- Cisco FMC API client can detect refresh token expiration and re-authenticate when it happens.
