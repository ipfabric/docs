--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

### Upgrade Notices

- During the update process, locked snapshots will be unloaded together with other snapshots and their lock will be preserved. Therefore, such snapshots won't be deleted by snapshot retention.
- Upgrade to `v6.4` may break custom SSO integrations and will require a change to the `/etc/ipf-dex.yaml` file. Since `6.3.2` release, we are omitting minor API version for SSO configuration and only major version will need to be changed with the next major IP Fabric version. Simply replace the `vX.Y` in this file with `v6` and then run `systemctl restart ipf-dex`.

  ```yaml
  staticClients:
    - id: ipfabric
      redirectURIs:
        - "https://demo1.eu.ipfabric.io/api/vX/auth/external/azure"
  ```

  For more information, please refer to the [SSO documentation](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/sso.md#sso-configuration-ipf-dexyaml). If you would like assistance please contact your Solution Architect.

### GUI

- Added support for bulk actions on Vendor APIs (in both the global and
  snapshot-specific settings). This is useful for enabling, disabling or
  deleting all (or multiple) Vendor APIs at once.

### Network Discovery

- IP Fabric
  - When the discovery process is automatically stopped due to a discovery
    service being restarted multiple times, the resulting snapshot will be
    marked as `FAILED` (and it will contain a `The discovery process failed.
    Data in this snapshot is incomplete.` note).
  - Discovery services `tasker` and `worker` can now use 10GB of RAM instead of 6GB.
- Palo Alto
  - PAN-OS -- added support for SNMP (see our
    [feature matrix](https://matrix.ipfabric.io) for more details)
- AWS
  - **Update the related IAM policy prior to upgrading to `6.4`.** Download the
    policy JSON file [IAM-policy-IPF_6.4.json](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/aws/IAM-policy-IPF_6.4.json).
  - Transit Gateway routing significant update -- added support for connect,
    peering and direct-connect-gateway attachments. Improved support for VPC and
    VPN attachments.
  - Initial Direct Connect support -- Direct Connect Gateway with transit
    virtual interfaces only. E2E path-lookup over Direct Connect isn't fully
    supported yet.
- New source of information for identifying neighbours
  - We now support **ACI endpoint tables** as a possible source of information
    for identifying neighbours during the discovery process. You may add/remove
    the `ACI endpoints` entry in the `What information is used to identify
    neighbours` field in **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery
    Settings --> Discovery tasks settings**.
    - We only consider devices as neighbours if their OUIs are enabled for
      discovery in **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Global Configuration
      --> OUI**.
