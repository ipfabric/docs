# IP Fabric v6.9

--8<-- "snippets/6.6.3_online_upgrade_issue.md"

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

### Upgrade Notices

- During the update process, locked snapshots will be unloaded together with
  other snapshots, and their locks will be preserved. Therefore, such snapshots
  won't be deleted by snapshot retention.
- The upgrade to version `6.9` may break custom SSO integrations and will
  require a change to the `/etc/ipf-dex.yaml` file. Since the `6.3.2` release,
  we are omitting the minor API version for SSO configuration, and only the
  major version will need to be changed with the next major IP Fabric version.
  Simply replace the `vX.Y` string in this file with `v6` and then run
  `systemctl restart ipf-dex`.

  ```yaml
  staticClients:
    - id: ipfabric
      redirectURIs:
        - "https://demo1.eu.ipfabric.io/api/v6/auth/external/azure"
  ```

  For more information, please refer to the
  [SSO documentation](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/sso.md#sso-configuration-ipf-dexyaml).
  If you would like assistance, please contact your Solution Architect.

### Security Fixes

#### Opengear Enable Passwords

The issue with enable passwords being logged in plaintext in the CLI log while
discovering Opengear devices with the `Neighbors` task enabled has been fixed.
For details and remediation, please see
[NIM-13396: Opengear â€“ Prevent `sudo` Password From Being Logged](../../support/security_bulletins.md#nim-13396-opengear-prevent-sudo-password-from-being-logged)
in our Security Bulletin.

#### Authentication Tokens

`accessToken` and `refreshToken` have been removed from the response body of all
endpoints (`/auth/login`, `/auth/token`, and `/auth/token/swap`) as a security
enhancement to protect against XSS attacks. If you use this authentication
method in your scripts, please update them to use the `Set-Cookie` headers. For
more details, see [Token API](../../IP_Fabric_API/authentication.md#token-api).

### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- Versa -- LLDP support was added.
- Stormshield (SN) -- Support for filter (firewall) rules was added.
- Brocade (FastIron) -- NTP support was added.
- Fortinet FortiGate -- SD-WAN support was added. For more details, see
  [Fortinet SD-WAN Known Issues](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/fortinet/sdwan.md).
- Citrix NetScaler ADC
  - Discovery has been permanently added to the product, so the
    [feature flag is no longer needed](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#citrix-netscaler-adc-discovery-removed-in-69).
  - Data collection for each ADC partition (routing, L3 interfaces, PBR, ARP,
    and virtual servers) was added.
- Overloaded server detection for HTTP/HTTPS-based Vendor APIs was improved.

### Performance Improvements

#### Post-Discovery Calculations

The following improvements were made in post-discovery caculations:

- Memory optimizations when saving STP edges.
- Increased speed of VLAN-related database queries.

#### Configuration Management

The speed of Configuration Management processing was improved by increasing the
number of devices being processed by a single `syslogWorker`. The default number
of CLI connections was increased from 10 to 80. If you need to lower the default
value, please [contact our Support team](https://support.ipfabric.io).

### Frontend

#### Simplified Vendor API Credential Management

- In this release, we have streamlined the process for managing Vendor API
  credentials. When editing Vendor API settings, it is no longer needed to 
  re-enter credentials each time.

### Settings

#### Advanced CLI

- The **Authentication failure** field (how many times to retry a connection
  when it fails on authentication) now has an increased maximum value of 5
  (previously 2). The default value remains 0.
- New timeout settings have been added:
   - [**Network device authentication timeout**](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/advanced_cli.md#network-device-authentication-timeout)
    - How many seconds to wait for the login prompt to appear.
    - The default value is 300 seconds.
   - [**Command response timeout**](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/advanced_cli.md#command-response-timeout)
    - How many minutes to wait for a device to finish sending the response to a 
      command.
    - The default value is 180 minutes.

#### Device Credentials

In global
([**Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery Settings --> Device Credentials**](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/device_credentials.md#configure-network-infrastructure-access))
and per-snapshot
([**Discovery Snapshot --> (specific snapshot) --> Settings --> Device Credentials**](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#snapshot-specific-settings))
settings, usernames and passwords now accept only ASCII printable characters.
Validation has been added to the credentials input.

### Technology Tables

#### Device Data in JSON

Device data can be now downloaded in JSON format. These are device data processed (parsed) by IP Fabric
from the CLI logs, which are used when devices are added to IP Fabric during snapshot discovery or load.

![Device JSON download](./6.9/JSON_download.png)

#### Device Discovery Duration

Start and end timestamps of individual device discovery have been added, and
these data are shown in new columns of the `Device Inventory` table (in
**Inventory --> Devices**):

![Discovery timestamps](./6.9/discovery-timestamps.png)

#### Technology --> SDWAN --> Versa

The **Technology --> SDWAN** section of the GUI was previously dedicated to
Versa SDWAN information only. In upcoming releases, this section will be
enriched by data from other SDWAN vendors. For this reason, a separate page for
Versa has been created.

### Path Lookup

#### Topology Improvements

- Neighbor calculation in STP over ACI scenarios has been improved.
- Fixed host-to-gateway simulation for wireless hosts connected to an AP.
- More realistic handling of VRF leaks in BGP routes.
- Fixed inconsistency in the graph comparison feature, where the same topology
  graph edges across two snapshots could be falsely reported as changed.

#### Security and ACI Improvements

- Rules received via API were not ordered correctly; they are now properly
  ordered by IP Fabric.
- Implicit and default rules can have the same priority and match the same
  traffic; implicit rules are now evaluated as the last ones.
- More accurate security evaluation for tunnels using zone firewalls.
- Improved security evaluation on spines where no endpoints are connected, and
  on leafs where no information about the endpoint's group is present.
- Improved handling of source and destination groups in ACI ACL rules.
- Improved handling of VXLAN network identifiers (`VNI`s) in output security
  evaluation.

### Appliance OS-Level Improvements

- The `nimpee-net-config` command for the First Boot Wizard has been changed to
  `ipf-cli-config`. Additionally, the First Boot Wizard is now referred to as 
  IPF CLI Config.
- Jumphost services have been renamed from `jumphost@<ID>.service` to
  `ipf-jumphost@<ID>.service` (with the addition of the `ipf-` prefix).

### Other Changes

- System Maintenance has been enhanced to remove snapshot data from the database
  that is no longer loaded in the IP Fabric appliance. Previously, this data
  could occasionally remain in the database, leading to increased memory
  resource requirements.

### Experimental Features

Newly added features that need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team, and we will gladly assist you with enabling these features.

#### VeloCloud

- Basic device info support has been added as a Proof of Concept (PoC) and needs
  to be [enabled manually via a feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#velocloud-discovery) (`ENABLE_DISCOVERY_DEVICES_VELOCLOUD`).

### Known Issues

#### Fortinet NAT44 and Zone Firewall Cause Discovery Issues in Version `6.9.x`

Temporarily disabling both `NAT44` and `Zone firewall` discovery tasks for the
`fortigate` **Family** (in **Settings --> Discovery & Snapshots --> Discovery
Settings --> Disabled Discovery Tasks**) is the recommended hotfix until this
issue is resolved in one of the upcoming releases.

#### Failing Upgrade to Version `6.9.4`

A bug was identified on IP Fabric appliances with initial deployment versions
`4.3.x` or earlier.

During the upgrade process to version `6.9.4`, the installation of the
`ipf-ethx` package fails, causing the entire upgrade process to stop.

This issue was fixed in the `6.9.6` release.

#### Bug Affecting Online Upgrade in Versions `6.9.4` and `6.9.6`

A critical bug was identified in the `6.9.4` and `6.9.6` releases, impacting the
online upgrade process to a next release. As a result, only manual upgrades
are possible for the affected versions.

Versions `6.8.x` and earlier remain unaffected by this issue.

This issue was fixed in the `6.9.7` release.

#### Failing Upgrade to `6.9.x` in Azure Environment

We have identified an issue with upgrading IP Fabric in the Azure environment
from any older versions to `6.9.x`.

The upgrade process becomes stuck at installing the `waagent` package, which
blocks the upgrade of all `ipf-` packages that now depend on it.

The issue arises because `6.9.x` attempts to install `waagent`, but this package
is native to Azure and is already installed by default on any Linux VMs in
Azure.

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the Azure instance via SSH as the `osadmin` user and run the
   following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo su -
   dpkg -l | grep -e '||/ Name' -e 'ipf-' # Check the status of the ipf- packages and their versions
   cp -p /var/lib/waagent/ovf-env.xml /root/
   systemctl stop walinuxagent.service
   rm -Rf /var/lib/waagent/
   apt install waagent # The command will appear stuck, but please let it run
   ```

2. Open another SSH session to the Azure instance in a different window, log in
   as `osadmin`, and run the following commands:

   ```shell
   sudo su -
   cp -p /root/ovf-env.xml /var/lib/waagent/
   ```

3. Once the `apt install waagent` command finishes, reboot the Azure instance
   by running the following command in any of the SSH sessions:

   ```shell
   reboot
   ```

4. After the Azure instance fully reboots, connect to it again via SSH as
   `osadmin` and re-check the status of the `ipf-` packages and their versions
   with the following command:

   ```shell
   dpkg -l | grep -e '||/ Name' -e 'ipf-'
   ```

   In the first column of the command output, you should see only `ii`.

   In the third column, you should see `6.9.x+y`, except for the following 
   `ipf-` packages, which have different versioning schemes:

   - `ipf-checker`
   - `ipf-cli-config`
   - `ipf-dex`
   - `ipf-ethx`
   - `ipf-jumphost`
   - `ipf-techsupport-exporter`

If you are unsure how to proceed or encounter any issues, please
[contact our Support team](https://support.ipfabric.io).
