### API Endpoints Deprecation

The below API endpoints have been marked as deprecated and the intention is to remove them in the next major version `8.0`.

- `/tables/networks/gatewayRedundancy`
- `/tables/networks/networks`

### System Administration UI Removal

The System Administration UI on port `8443` has been deprecated in version `7.0` and is no longer accessible. All its functionalities have been replaced by an alternative:

* [System Status](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/tips/system_status.md)
* [Backup and Maintenance](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/backup_restore_CLI.md)
* [System Update](../../System_Administration/system_update.md)
* [Restore Admin Access](../../System_Administration/IPF_CLI_Config/set_gui_admin_pass.md)

### RBAC Fixes

After reviewing our built-in RBAC policies, we have made the following changes. This is to ensure that the policies
are more consistent with the intended use cases. If your roles require access to these endpoints, please create a
[custom RBAC policy](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/policies.md) and assign it to the 
[required role(s)](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/roles.md).

These policies have been removed from the built-in `others` (ID of `read`) and moved to `settings`:

- `POST /os/generate-nimpee-cert`: Generate IP Fabric certificate
- `POST /os/upload-nimpee-cert`: Upload certificate to platform
- `POST /os/maintenance`: Trigger platform maintenance
- `POST /os/snapshots-retention`: Trigger snapshot retention
- `POST /os/techsupport`: Generate techsupport file
- `POST /os/clean-db`: Clean system database
- `POST /jobs/{key}/cancel`: Cancel specific job
- `POST /jobs/{key}/force-stop`: Force stop running system job
- `POST /jobs/{key}/stop`: Stop running system job
- `GET /jobs/{key}/download`: Return result of system job
  - With the introduction of the new [Configuration Import/Export](#configuration-importexport) users without `settings` policies are able to download and view all settings.
  - Our team is working on a feature to provide RBAC based on the type of file (configuration, snapshot, techsupport). This will be available in a future release.

### System upgrade improvements

- The upgrade UI has switched from basic HTTP authentication to cookie/session-based authentication.
- Downloading a remote upgrade package via the UI now displays download progress, which is also logged in the systemd journal.
- Improved timeout management provides better handling on systems with slow disk I/O or during network interruptions.

### Layout Optimization for Large Circular Graphs

Circular graphs with over 100 nodes experienced slow rendering and oversized layouts due to complex line-crossing minimization calculations. This also impacted snapshot discovery/loading performance due to prolonged node position caching.

For graphs exceeding 100 nodes, we now automatically apply the **universal layout** instead of the circular layout. This ensures:

- Faster rendering (reduced layout computation time)
- Improved readability of large graphs
- Optimized snapshot performance (quicker node position caching)

The layout type change (circular --> universal) is not yet reflected in API responses or the UI. This visibility will be added in an upcoming release.

### New Features

#### Configuration Import/Export

- We have developed a new feature that allows you to import and export configurations of the IP Fabric application across multiple IP Fabric instances.
  More details can be found on the [Configuration Import/Export](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/system/Backup_and_Maintenance/configuration_import_export.md) page.

#### Automated SSO

- We have developed a new script to simplify the SSO setup process for the IP
  Fabric application. More details can be found on the
  [Automated Single Sign-On (SSO)](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/administration/sso.md/#automated-sso-enablement-for-the-ipf-application)
  page.

#### Azure Network Load Balancers (NLB) support

- Data collection and end-to-end path lookup via NLB nodes are supported. However, path lookup via Azure private links is not supported yet.
  
  !!! warning "Do not forget to update IAM policy"

      To collect Azure Network Load Balancers, the corresponding IAM policy must be updated.
      You can download the new policy [here](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/azure/azure-role-7_2.json).

#### Enhanced BGP Community Controls for Optimized Discovery

- Introduced per-device, per-protocol (IPv4/IPv6), and per-VRF BGP community configurations to limit downloaded routes during discovery.
- This feature prioritizes community-based filtering over global thresholds, ensuring precise data collection while reducing processing time. Ideal for large-scale networks with extensive BGP tables. For more information see [Routing](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/routing.md)

#### Connections between IPsec & VXLAN tunnel endpoints now visible in path-lookup

- For easier identification of where IPsec and VXLAN tunnels start and end, especially when traversing multiple devices, direct links between tunnel endpoints
are now visible in path lookups. More details can be found in [IPsec & VXLAN tunnel endpoints](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/diagrams/how_to_use_path-lookup.md/#ipsec-vxlan-tunnel-endpoints).

#### BGP Route Collection Enhancement

We have introduced filtered BGP route collection support, allowing network administrators to explicitly define which networks to collect. This enables focused BGP route analysis while optimizing system resources across **Cisco IOS/IOS-XE**, **IOS-XR**, **NX-OS**, **Juniper JunOS** and **Arista EOS** platforms.

For detailed information about the new API endpoints and configuration options, see [BGP Route Collection API](../../IP_Fabric_API/Settings/bgp_route_collection.md).

### Improvements

#### GUI

- We have updated default tabs settings for consoleServer devices in Device Explorer:
  added Serial Ports, removed QoS, MAC and Port Channel. This resets previous tab settings for this device type.
- Edges in topology graphs now support multiple labels, which can be displayed either inline or on separate lines. These settings are customizable in the Visualization Setup panel of the Network Viewer, allowing configuration for each protocol or group type individually.
- Additional columns were added to **Inventory --> Interfaces** table, all hidden by default:
  - `Clearing Type`
  - `Clearing Value`
  - `Last Input Type`
  - `Last Input Value`
  - `Last Output Type`
  - `Last Output Value`
- An additional column  was added to **the Inventory --> Devices** table and is hidden by default:
  - `Credentials Notes`

#### Advanced Filters

- **Device Attribute-Based Advanced Filters**
  now supports Attributes as a device property.

  This allows you to:

  - Filter data using predefined Attributes, such as `siteName`.
  - Use custom Attributes for more specific filtering.

- For a complete list of properties and supported tables, refer to [Technology Tables -- Device-Based Advanced Filters](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#device-based-advanced-filters).

#### Discovery Settings

- Saving discovery settings with missing or expired credentials is now allowed. Users can decide whether the
  missing data is important for running the discovery or can add the data later. Clear messages and dialogs
  will inform users of any potential issues.

#### Network Discovery

- **New Capabilities -- Cisco (FTD), Fortinet (FortiGate), PaloAlto (PAN-OS)**

  - Support for URL filtering has been added.
  - In Path Lookup under `Advanced Packet Options`, new search fields are now available:
    - `Site category`: Matches the name of a URL filter category. Works for both built-in and custom categories. The field accepts regex if multiple categories are needed in the result.
    - `URL / DOMAIN`: Matches a specific URL against applicable security rules.

- **New Capabilities -- PaloAlto (PAN-OS)**
  - Support for URL-type objects of `External Dynamic List` has been added.

- **New Capabilities -- Fortinet (FortiGate)**
  - Support for URL-type objects of `External Resource` has been added.

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- Added Silver Peak API key authentication support.
- Added IPv6 BGP neighbors support for Arista (EOS), Cisco (IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS), FS (FSOS), PaloAlto (PAN-OS).
- Added support for IPv6 BGP Route limit - [see documentation](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery/limit_download_of_bgp_routes.md)
  - Arista: EOS
  - Cisco: NX-OS, IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR, Viptela
  - Juniper: JunOS
  - Nokia: TiMOS
- Added URL filtering support in firewall rules for Cisco (FTD), Fortinet (FortiGate), PaloAlto (PAN-OS).
- Added support for SR-MPLS TE with BGP On-Demand Next Hop (ODN) functionality for Cisco (IOS-XR).
- Added threat feeds support for FortiGate firewalls (IP lists only).
- The HP vendor has been renamed to HPE.
- The bookmark `Detail` for all AWS devices has changed. The differences are:
  - The `Family` column value is now empty (previously was set to `ec2`)
  - The `Version` column value is now empty (previously was set to `2016-11-15`)

#### Technology Tables

- **Unmanaged Neighbors Detail** -- Fixed an issue in the **Technology --> Interfaces --> Connectivity matrix --> Unmanaged Neighbors Detail** table where Intent Verification rules could incorrectly highlight rows for specific datasets. Unique row IDs have been enforced to resolve the inconsistency.

  !!! important

      If Intent Verification rules were configured for this table, you may need to trigger their recalculation. To do this, you can either:

      - In **local settings** of the relevant snapshot(s), toggle **"Compute Intent Verification"** off, save settings, then toggle the rule back on; or

       ![Toggle "Compute Intent Verification"](7.2_toggle_intent_verification.png){ width="600" .center}

      - Manually unload and reload the relevant snapshot(s)

#### Site separation

- Devices now automatically inherit their site name from connected peers via **CDP/LLDP**, **STP topology neighbors**, or devices in the same **L3 network**, in order of priority, when rule **Try to assign devices without sites based on device neighborship** is enabled.
