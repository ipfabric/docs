### Breaking Changes

#### API Endpoints Deprecation

The below API endpoints have been marked as deprecated and the intention is to
remove them in the next major version `7.0`.

- `/tables/interfaces/transfer-rates/*`
- `/tables/interfaces/errors/*` except for `/tables/interfaces/errors/disabled`
- `/tables/interfaces/drops/*`

### Security Fixes

### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support and Improvements

- Cisco APIC -- when an unsupported class is received in API response, the
  unsupported class is removed in the next request. Previously, this
functionality did not work when the `returnPartialData` configuration parameter
was set to `true`. This issue has been fixed in this release.

### Performance Improvements

#### Versa Routing Table Processing

The processing speed of routing tables has been dramatically improved, resulting
in a significant performance boost. This enhancement resolves issues where
discovery process would get stuck when processing very large routing tables.
