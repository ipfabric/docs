## Known Issues

## Improvements

SSH client now recognizes SSH protocol version 2.99 and is able to connect to [affected Cisco IOS devices](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/cisco/Invalid_Identification_String.md).

### Security Hardening

Default permissions for newly created user home directories have been changed.


- **Previous default**: `0755 (rwxr-xr-x)` — Home directories readable and traversable by all local users.
- **Current default**: `0700 (rwx------)` — Home directories are now accessible only by the owning user.

For more details, see [Home Directory Permissions](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/index.md#default-home-directory-permissions).

#### Vendor Support

- **GCP** -- Added support for classic and modern passthrough load balancers.

### Miscellaneous

- The `ipf-checker` now reports more accurate values. These changes do not affect any functionality (only increased values are observed).
