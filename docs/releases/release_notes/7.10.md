## Known Issues

### Security Hardening

Default permissions for newly created user home directories have been changed.


- **Previous default**: `0755 (rwxr-xr-x)` — Home directories readable and traversable by all local users.
- **Current default**: `0700 (rwx------)` — Home directories are now accessible only by the owning user.

For more details, see [Home Directory Permissions](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/index.md#default-home-directory-permissions).
