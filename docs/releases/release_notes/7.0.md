## v7.0.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Breaking Changes

#### API Endpoint Changes

Several API endpoints have been updated or removed in this major release.

##### Replaced Endpoints

- `/tables/sdwan/links` has been replaced by `/tables/sdwan/versa/links`
- `/tables/sdwan/sites` has been replaced by `/tables/sdwan/versa/sites`
- `/tables/load-balancing/f5-partitions` has been replaced by `/tables/load-balancing/partitions`
- `/tables/mpls/l2vpn/curcit-cross-connect` has been replaced by `/tables/mpls/l2vpn/circuit-cross-connect`
- `/tables/cloud/virtual-machines-interfaces` has been replaced by `/tables/cloud/endpoints/virtual-machines-interfaces`
- `/tables/cloud/virtual-machines` has been replaced by `/tables/cloud/endpoints/virtual-machines`
- `/tables/management/osver-consistency` has been replaced by:
  - `/tables/inventory/os-version-consistency/platforms`
  - `/tables/inventory/os-version-consistency/models`

API version is no longer part of the token endpoint, rendering the following path inaccessible:

- `<API_VERSION>/auth/token` (use `/auth/token` instead)

##### Removed Endpoints

The following endpoints have been permanently removed:

- `/tables/networks/domain`
- `/tables/spanning-tree/radius`
- `/tables/spanning-tree/topology`
- `/tables/addresing/path-lookup-sources`
- `/tables/attributes/summary`
- `/tables/interfaces/transfer-rates/*`
- `/tables/interfaces/errors/*` except for `/tables/interfaces/errors/disabled`
- `/tables/interfaces/drops/*`

#### Replaced Endpoint Properties

The following column names have been changed:

- `/tables/management/ntp/summary`: `reachableSources` -> `synchronizedSources`
- `/tables/management/ntp/sources`: `reachable` -> `sync`

!!! info "NTP Synchronization Status"

    It was determined that some vendors report a reachable status along with a synchronization
    status causing the data to incorrectly mark some sources as not reachable.  These columns
    were renamed to more accurately describe their property.

#### Removed Endpoint Properties

The following properties have been removed from tables:

- `/tables/networks/policies/routing/interfaces`: `status`
- `/tables/inventory/devices`: `mac`

#### Removed alias `f` in URLs

- Support for `f` as an alias for `filters` in table URLs has been dropped.

  - This URL is **no longer** supported:

    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"f":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

  - This URL remains supported:

    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"filters":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

### Technology Tables

#### SDWAN

New vendor specific tables were added under **Technology --> SDWAN** menu. Support for [Cisco Viptela](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/SDWAN/viptela.md) and [Silverpeak](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/SDWAN/silverpeak.md) was added.

#### RP Mappings groups

A potential issue was resolved where intent verification rules might have incorrectly highlighted rows in the table for certain data sets in **Technology --> Multicast --> RP --> RP Mappings groups**. This was addressed by ensuring that the ID of each individual row is now truly unique.

**If intent verification rules are already configured for this table**, it may be necessary to perform a **snapshot unload and reload** to ensure the existing intent rules function properly.

### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support

- Check Point -- Identity awareness collecting was updated with a new extended
  command. For more details, see
  [Checkpoint Known Issues](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md).
- Stormshield
  - Support for the collection of NAT rules has been added.
  - Starting from the 7.0 release, Stormshield devices are now discovered automatically, and the feature flag no longer needs to be enabled.

#### Improvements

##### Site Separation

The [Site Separation](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/site_separation.md)
functionality using regular expressions was improved, allowing for the creation
of advanced **Site Name** values with template strings.

##### Duplicate IP Discovery

Duplicate IPs discovery, initially configured using the environment variable
`SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP` since the `6.4` release, has now been
promoted to a product feature. This setting can now be configured [directly in
the GUI](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery/duplicate_ips_discovery.md).

If you previously used the `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP` feature
flag, you will need to manually reconfigure the subnets in the GUI.

##### `actrlRule` Endpoint Paging

The Cisco APIC `actrlRule` API endpoint now has a default paging size of 50,000 records (previously, the lack of a paging limit led to slow or unsuccessful data collection). The page size can be adjusted using the `ACI_ACTRLRULE_PAGESIZE` configuration flag. Please contact our Support team if you need to lower the default paging size.

##### NSX-T Rate Limiter

A bug was discovered in the NSX-T API rate limiter, where in rare cases, it was not being enforced. This led to the NSX-T server becoming overloaded, resulting in unsuccessful discovery.

The statistical logs for all Vendor APIs have been enhanced to now include the number of requests sent per time period.

### Frontend

#### Available data for incomplete snapshots

GUI now shows available data (tables, diagrams) for snapshots that are still in progress or in error state.
Note that those data may be incomplete, and it may even take some time for a device to appear in Devices table
after it is discovered, but still most of the data are usually available much earlier before discovery finishes.    

#### Sharable links

- Added support for
  [URL links that point to a specific snapshot](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#create-url-pointing-to-specific-snapshot).
- Links to tables can now be shared
  [with a snapshot ID and full filter representation](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#create-links-to-table-views).

### Configuration Management

#### Versa

- Support for configuration backup was added for Versa devices when the discovery is running in [Combined (CLI+API) discovery mode](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Versa_Networks_SD-WAN.md).

#### Removed tables

The following tables have been removed from the product.

- `Technology - Interfaces - Average Rates - Data`
- `Technology - Interfaces - Average Rates - Errors`
- `Technology - Interfaces - Average Rates - Drops`

### Other Changes

- Techsupport files are now compressed with `zstd` instead of `gzip` for
  improved speed and compression ratio.
- `nimpee-net-config` was renamed to `ipf-cli-config`
- `ipf-cli-config` removes `proxy.cred` for OpenVPN when setting up anonymous proxy
- `docker` runtime was added to the appliance.
- PostgreSQL 15 was added to the appliance.
- New script in `/opt/ipf-debian-repositories/bin/ipf-debian-repositories.sh` can be
  [used to re-enable Debian repositories](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/add_system_repositories.md).

### New Tables

The following new tables have been added to the product (in addition to the ones listed in
[Replaced Endpoints](#replaced-endpoints). Please ensure if using custom RBAC you review your policies and roles to
ensure your users have appropriate permissions to view these if allowed.

- `/tables/routing/protocols/bgp/routes`
- `/tables/cloud/vendors/aws/inventory`
- `/tables/cloud/vendors/azure/inventory`
- `/tables/cloud/vendors/gcp/inventory`
- `/tables/cloud/nodes/inventory`
- `/tables/cloud/nodes/tags`
- `/tables/sdwan/silverpeak/overlay`
- `/tables/sdwan/silverpeak/underlay`
- `/tables/sdwan/viptela/bfd-sessions`
- `/tables/sdwan/viptela/bfd-summary`
- `/tables/sdwan/viptela/control-connections`

!!! note "Solution Architect Managed RBAC"

    The Solution Architect team has published a
    [managed RBAC configuration](https://gitlab.com/ip-fabric/integrations/python-ipfabric/-/blob/develop/examples/settings/RBAC/managed_rbac.py?ref_type=heads)
    located in the Python SDK which is updated on every major and minor release.  This should be run after every upgrade
    if you decide to use these policies and roles.

### Device-based Advanced Filters

In many **Technology** and **Inventory** tables, you can now use advanced filters
  based on device properties like **Vendor**, **Family**, **Model**, **Version**. For full properties and tables list refer to [Device-based advanced filters](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#device-based-advanced-filters).

### Interactive API Documentation

We're excited to introduce an interactive API documentation powered by RapiDoc, now available at `https://<host>/api/rapidoc`!

This new feature offers comprehensive documentation for all API endpoints, including predefined schemas. It allows you to explore and test the API's capabilities directly from your browser. By adding this feature, we aim to enhance your development experience and simplify the integration process.

### Experimental Features

Newly added features that need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team, and we will gladly help you with enabling these features.

- VeloCloud
  - VeloCloud discovery has been enhanced with basic networking support. To enable VeloCloud discovery, you must [manually activate the feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#velocloud-discovery) (`ENABLE_DISCOVERY_DEVICES_VELOCLOUD`).
