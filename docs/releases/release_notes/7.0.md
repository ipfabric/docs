## v7.0.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Network Discovery

- Check Point -- Identity awareness collecting was updated with a new extended
  command. For more details, see 
  [Checkpoint Known Issues](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md).

### Frontend

- Support for `f` as an alias for `filters` in table URLs has been dropped.
  - This URL is **no longer** supported:<br/>
    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"f":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`
  - This URL is supported:<br/>
    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"filters":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`
- Added support for
  [URL links that point to a specific snapshot](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#create-url-pointing-to-specific-snapshot).
- Links to tables can now be shared
  [with a snapshot ID and full filter representation](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#create-links-to-table-views).

### Other Changes

- Techsupport files are now compressed with `zstd` instead of `gzip` for
  improved speed and compression ratio.
- [Duplicate IPs Discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery/duplicate_ips_discovery.md),
  configured since the `6.4` release using the environment variable
  `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, has been promoted to a product
  feature and can now be set directly in GUI.
  - If you previously configured `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, you
    will have to manually set the subnets in the GUI again.
- `nimpee-net-config` was renamed to `ipf-cli-config`
- `ipf-cli-config` removes `proxy.cred` for OpenVPN when setting up anonymous proxy

### Experimental Features

Newly added features that need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team, and we will gladly help you with enabling these features.

  - VeloCloud discovery has been enhanced with basic networking support. To enable VeloCloud discovery, you must [manually activate the feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#velocloud-discovery) (`ENABLE_DISCOVERY_DEVICES_VELOCLOUD`).
