## v7.0.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Breaking Changes

#### API Endpoint Changes

Several API endpoints have been updated or removed in this major release.

##### Replaced Endpoints

- `technology/sdwan/links` has been replaced by `technology/sdwan/versa/links`
- `technology/sdwan/sites` has been replaced by `technology/sdwan/versa/sites`
- `technology/load-balancing/f5-partitions` has been replaced by `technology/load-balancing/partitions`
- `technology/mpls/l2vpn/curcit-cross-connect` has been replaced by `technology/mpls/l2vpn/circuit-cross-connect`

##### Removed Endpoints

The following endpoints have been permanently removed:

- `technology/networks/domain`
- `technology/spanning-tree/radius`
- `technology/spanning-tree/topology`
- `technology/addresing/path-lookup-sources`
- `technology/attributes/summary`

#### Changes in columns

##### Removed Column

The `mac` column in the Device Inventory table (`/tables/inventory/devices`) has been removed.

##### Replaced Columns

The following column names have been changed:

- `/tables/management/ntp/summary`: `reachableSources` -> `synchronizedSources`
- `/tables/management/ntp/sources`: `reachable` -> `sync`

!!! info "NTP Synchronization Status"

    It was determined that some vendors report a reachable status along with a synchronization
    status causing the data to incorrectly mark some sources as not reachable.  These columns
    were renamed to more accurately describe their property.

#### Removed alias `f` in URLs

- Support for `f` as an alias for `filters` in table URLs has been dropped.
  - This URL is **no longer** supported:

    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"f":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

  - This URL remains supported:

    `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"filters":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

### Network Discovery

#### Vendor Support

- Check Point -- Identity awareness collecting was updated with a new extended
  command. For more details, see
  [Checkpoint Known Issues](../../support/known_issues/Vendors/checkpoint.md).

#### Improvements

- [Site Separation](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/site_separation.md)
  functionality using regular expressions was improved with the option
  to build advanced **Site Name** values using template strings.
- [Duplicate IPs Discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery/duplicate_ips_discovery.md),
  configured since the `6.4` release using the environment variable
  `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, has been promoted to a product
  feature and can now be set directly in GUI.
  - If you previously configured `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, you
    will have to manually set the subnets in the GUI again.

### Frontend

#### Sharable links 

- Added support for
  [URL links that point to a specific snapshot](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/discovery_snapshot.md#create-url-pointing-to-specific-snapshot).
- Links to tables can now be shared
  [with a snapshot ID and full filter representation](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#create-links-to-table-views).

### Configuration Management

#### Versa

- Support for configuration backup was added for Versa devices when the discovery is running in [Combined (CLI+API) discovery mode](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/Vendors_API/Versa_Networks_SD-WAN.md).

### Other Changes

- Techsupport files are now compressed with `zstd` instead of `gzip` for
  improved speed and compression ratio.
- `nimpee-net-config` was renamed to `ipf-cli-config`
- `ipf-cli-config` removes `proxy.cred` for OpenVPN when setting up anonymous proxy
- `docker` runtime was added to the appliance.
- PostgreSQL 15 was added to the appliance.
- New script in `/opt/ipf-debian-repositories/bin/ipf-debian-repositories.sh` can be
 [used to re-enable Debian repositories](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/How_to/add_system_repositories.md).

### Experimental Features

Newly added features that need to be explicitly enabled in service files. If
you are interested in trying them out, please contact our Support or Solution
Architect team, and we will gladly help you with enabling these features.

- VeloCloud
  - VeloCloud discovery has been enhanced with basic networking support. To enable VeloCloud discovery, you must [manually activate the feature flag](../../System_Administration/Command_Line_Interface/Feature_Flags.md#velocloud-discovery) (`ENABLE_DISCOVERY_DEVICES_VELOCLOUD`).
