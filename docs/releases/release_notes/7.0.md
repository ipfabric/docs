### Frontend

- Support for `f` as an alias for `filters` in table URLs has been dropped.

### Other Changes

- Techsupport files are now compressed with `zstd` instead of `gzip` for
  improved speed and compression ratio.
- [Duplicate IPs Discovery](../../IP_Fabric_Settings/Discovery_and_Snapshots/Discovery_Settings/discovery/duplicate_ips_discovery.md),
  configured since the `6.4` release using the environment variable
  `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, has been promoted to a product
  feature and can now be set directly in GUI.
  - If you previously configured `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, you
    will have to manually set the subnets in the GUI again.
- `nimpee-net-config` was renamed to `ipf-cli-config`
- `ipf-cli-config` removes `proxy.cred` for OpenVPN when setting up anonymous proxy
