!!! danger "Unreleased Version"

    This is an upcoming IP Fabric version, which has not been released yet and
    is not available for download.

--8<-- "snippets/upgrade_version_policy.md"

--8<-- "snippets/clear_browser_cache.md"

## v7.0.0 (UNRELEASED)

### Post-Upgrade Notices

If you are using custom Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain IP Fabric elements based on role, ensure that users have the appropriate permissions for new tables and capabilities. After the upgrade, please run the script found in the Python SDK: [Managed RBAC Configuration](https://gitlab.com/ip-fabric/integrations/python-ipfabric/-/blob/develop/examples/settings/RBAC/managed_rbac.py) (`managed_rbac.py`).

### New Features

#### GUI

- **Early Snapshot-Data Availability** -- The GUI now shows available data (tables and diagrams) for snapshots that are still in progress or in an error state.

  !!! important

      Since this data is displayed while still being processed, it may be incomplete.

- **Shareable Snapshot and Tables** -- Easily share specific snapshots and tables with your team using shareable links in the GUI.

#### Cloud

- **New Cloud Tables** -- New public-cloud tables provide more information for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP):

  - **AWS**
    - `/tables/cloud/vendors/aws/inventory`
  - **Azure**
    - `/tables/cloud/vendors/azure/inventory`
  - **GCP**
    - `/tables/cloud/vendors/gcp/inventory`
  - **General Public Cloud Tables**
    - `/tables/cloud/nodes/inventory`
    - `/tables/cloud/nodes/tags`

#### SD-WAN

- **New Vendor Added -- Cisco Viptela** -- New tables collect Bi-directional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and control plane connection data.

  - **BFD Sessions Table** -- Contains IP addresses, Site IDs, encapsulation type, source and destination IP addresses and ports, interface information, and uptime status.
  - **Control Connections Table** -- Contains peer type and protocol, Site ID, peer private/public IP and port, and uptime status.
  - **BFD Summarization Table** -- Displays the number of total sessions, active sessions, sessions flapping, and the maximum sessions allowed.

- **New Vendor Added -- Silverpeak** -- New tables show overlay and underlay information:

  - **Overlay Table** -- Contains SD-WAN bonded tunnel information with status and uptime.
  - **Underlay Table** -- Contains IPsec tunnels that map to discrete transports.

- **New Capability Added -- Versa Networks** -- Configuration backup support has been added for devices when network discovery is running in combined/hybrid (CLI+API) mode.

#### Network Discovery

- **New Capabilities -- Check Point** -- The ability to collect Enforcement Point data using a new extended command, allowing access to expert mode when explicitly defined.

- **New Capabilities -- Stormshield:**

  - Support for collecting NAT rules has been added.
  - Stormshield devices are now discovered automatically by default.

- **Duplicate IP Discovery** -- The ability to discover duplicate IP addresses in the same network can now be allowed explicitly in the GUI.

  !!! important

      If you previously configured `SUBNETS_TO_ALLOW_PROCESSING_DUPLICIT_IP`, you will need to manually set the subnets again in the GUI.

#### Interactive API Documentation

- **Explore and Test Workflows Directly From the API Documentation** -- Interactive API documentation (powered by `RapiDoc`) allows you to see predefined schemas and run CRUD commands directly from your web browser.

#### Dynamic Routing

- **New BGP Table** -- A new table has been added to provide more information about BGP routes:
  - `/tables/routing/protocols/bgp/routes`

#### Support for Future Functionality

- **Docker Container Support** -- Docker runtime has been added to the appliance for future accelerated extensibility.
- **New Database Added** -- PostgreSQL 15 has been added to the appliance for future scalability and performance improvements.
- **Add External Services to Appliance** -- A new script, `/opt/ipf-debian-repositories/bin/ipf-debian-repositories.sh`, can be used to re-enable official Debian repositories.

### Improvements

- **Device-Based Advanced Filters** -- Filter tables based on device properties such as `Vendor`, `Family`, `Model`, and `Version`.
  - For a full list of properties, see [Technology Tables -- Device-Based Advanced Filters](../../IP_Fabric_GUI/technology_tables/index.md#device-based-advanced-filters).
- **Site Separation Automatic Site Name Identification** -- Enhanced the option to build advanced Site Name values using RegEx template strings.

- **Format Change for Techsupport Files** -- Techsupport files are now compressed with `zstd` (instead of `gzip`) for improved speed and compression ratio.

- **Unnecessary Tables Have Been Removed:**

  - **Technology --> Interfaces --> Average Rates --> Data**
  - **Technology --> Interfaces --> Average Rates --> Errors**
  - **Technology --> Interfaces --> Average Rates --> Drops**

- **Renamed Initial Configuration Command**
  - This is a reminder that in the previous `6.9.x` release, `nimpee-net-config` was renamed to `ipf-cli-config` to align with the current product name.
    - This change remains valid for `7.0.x` and newer versions.

### API Changes

- **API Endpoint Changes** -- Several API endpoints have been updated or removed in this major release. This could result in breaking your automation and system workflows. Please consult your Operations or DevOps team to double-check if you use these endpoints.

#### Replaced Endpoints

- `/tables/sdwan/links` --> `/tables/sdwan/versa/links`
- `/tables/sdwan/sites` --> `/tables/sdwan/versa/sites`
- `/tables/load-balancing/f5-partitions` --> `/tables/load-balancing/partitions`
- `/tables/mpls/l2vpn/curcit-cross-connect` --> `/tables/mpls/l2vpn/circuit-cross-connect`
- `/tables/cloud/virtual-machines-interfaces` --> `/tables/cloud/endpoints/virtual-machines-interfaces`
- `/tables/cloud/virtual-machines` --> `/tables/cloud/endpoints/virtual-machines`

- `/tables/management/osver-consistency` replaced with the following:

  - `/tables/inventory/os-version-consistency/platforms`
  - `/tables/inventory/os-version-consistency/models`

- The API version is no longer part of the token endpoint, making the following path inaccessible:

  - `<API_VERSION>/auth/token`
  - Please use `/auth/token` instead.

#### Removed Endpoints

- `/tables/networks/domain`
- `/tables/spanning-tree/radius`
- `/tables/spanning-tree/topology`
- `/tables/addresing/path-lookup-sources`
- `/tables/attributes/summary`
- `/tables/interfaces/transfer-rates/*`
- `/tables/interfaces/errors/*`
  - except `/tables/interfaces/errors/disabled`
- `/tables/interfaces/drops/*`

#### Replaced Endpoint Properties

- **NTP Synchronization Status** -- Some vendors report reachable status along with synchronization status, leading to incorrectly marking some sources as not reachable.
  - The following columns have been renamed to more accurately reflect their property:
    - `/tables/management/ntp/summary`: `reachableSources` --> `synchronizedSources`
    - `/tables/management/ntp/sources`: `reachable` --> `sync`

#### Removed Endpoint Properties

- `/tables/networks/policies/routing/interfaces: status`
- `/tables/inventory/devices: mac`

#### Removed Alias `f` in URLs

- Support for `f` as an alias for `filters` in table URLs has been dropped.

  !!! example "Removed URL"

      `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"f":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

  !!! example "Still Supported URL"

      `https://<IPF_IP_or_FQDN>/inventory/os-versions?options={"filters":{"and":[{"version":["eq","15.5(2)T"]},{"platform":["eq","i86bi_linux"]}]}}`

### Fixes

- **RP Mappings Groups** -- Ensured the ID of each individual row is unique, resolving a potential issue where Intent Verification rules might have incorrectly highlighted rows in the table for certain datasets.

  !!! important

      If Intent Verification rules were configured for this table, you may need to manually unload and reload specific snapshots to ensure proper functionality.

- **NSX-T Rate Limiter** -- Fixed a bug where, in rare cases, NSX-T discovery issues occurred due to the NSX-T server becoming overloaded.
