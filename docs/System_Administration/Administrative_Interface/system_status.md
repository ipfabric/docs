# System Status

When you login to the System Administration with the `osadmin` user
you will find yourself in **System status** interface.

![system status](system_status.png)

This interface shows running IP Fabric services, present disk, CPU and memory
usage, and top processes run by the system.

The whole IP Fabric platform can be restarted or shut down from the
**System status** interface.

When running a discovery, active discovery services can also be found
here.
