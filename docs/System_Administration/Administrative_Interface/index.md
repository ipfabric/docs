# Overview

For system status; backup and restore; upgrade; and administratorÂ tasks, IP
Fabric has a dedicated web-based administrative interface that is fully
separate from the primary system functions. The administrative interface is
available through port `8443`. e.g. `https://ipfabric.company.com:8443` and uses
`osadmin` credentials defined during the [First Boot
Wizard](../../Getting_Started/Platform_First_Steps/01-deployment/#complete-first-time-boot-wizard).
