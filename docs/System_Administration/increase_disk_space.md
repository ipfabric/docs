description: Appliance disk space can be extended by extending existing virtual disk or by adding new empty virtual hard drive to IP Fabric VM.

# Increase Disk Space

Starting version IP Fabric 5.0.0, appliance is distributed as one hard disk installation instead of two.

IP Fabric appliance is using LVM type for **root** and **swap** partitions.

On default installation **swap** has 16GB and **root** has ~72GB of space.

We automatically resize the **boot** disk as follows:

 * resize primary partition to full size of the disk
 * resize extended partition to full size of primary partition
 * extend `ipfabric-vg/root` to `+100%FREE`
 * online resize `ext4` partition


## Increasing Disk Space On IP Fabric Appliance

If you need any help with a disk space expansion, please contact our [Support Team](../support/index.md)

### Resizing Root/First Disk

The easiest way how to resize IP Fabric system disk is to

1. Shutdown the appliance

2. Resize root/first disk to a desired size

3. Start virtual machine

`cloud-init` will take care of resizing this disk.

### Expanding System Volume By Adding Additional Disk(s)

If you want to add secondary or any additional disk as a system disk, you will need to manually add it to `ipfabric-vg/root` volume.

To do that follow LVM resource:

 * [Debian LVM wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/LVM)
 * [Arch LVM wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LVM)


## Local Backup Disk

!!! note "Backup Disk"

    Backup disk is not present by default! Please add a new virtual disk to enable local backups.

When enabling local backups, a [backup](../IP_Fabric_Settings/advanced/system/system_backup.md) tool creates backups to the `/backup` directory.
The tool first checks if the local backup directory exists and then the backups are created.

Any additional disk or LVM volume (see hypervisor specific configuration on the bottom of this page) of your choice can be mounted as a backup directory.
We recommend using for local backups an additional disk that is physically located on a different datastore then the root volume.

### Example Of A Physical Disk Being Mounted To `/backup` Directory

Find a device which you want to use as a `/backup` directory. In this case `/dev/sdb`.

```
osadmin@ST-105:~$ lsblk
NAME                    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda                       8:0    0 19.1G  0 disk
|-sda1                    8:1    0  487M  0 part /boot
|-sda2                    8:2    0    1K  0 part
`-sda5                    8:5    0 18.6G  0 part
  |-ipfabric--vg-root   254:0    0 17.6G  0 lvm  /
  `-ipfabric--vg-swap_1 254:1    0  980M  0 lvm  [SWAP]
sdb                       8:16   0   20G  0 disk             # <- I want to use this device for a /backup directory
sr0                      11:0    1 1024M  0 rom
```


Create a filesystem on the new `/dev/sdb` disk (in this example `ext4`)

```
osadmin@ST-105:~$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb
mke2fs 1.46.2 (28-Feb-2021)
Discarding device blocks: done
Creating filesystem with 5242880 4k blocks and 1310720 inodes
Filesystem UUID: beb1625a-7d35-404b-bb05-972a46b8becf
Superblock backups stored on blocks:
	32768, 98304, 163840, 229376, 294912, 819200, 884736, 1605632, 2654208,
	4096000

Allocating group tables: done
Writing inode tables: done
Creating journal (32768 blocks): done
Writing superblocks and filesystem accounting information: done
```

Note down `Filesystem UUID` from previous example.

If you loose history of terminal output, you can find it later with the following command

```
osadmin@ST-105:~$ sudo blkid --output value --match-tag UUID /dev/sdb
beb1625a-7d35-404b-bb05-972a46b8becf
```

Create a new [fstab](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fstab) entry

!!! info

    We strongly recommend only LVM partition, LABEL and UUID in `fstab`, for more info see
    [Persistent block device naming](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Persistent_block_device_naming).

```
UUID=beb1625a-7d35-404b-bb05-972a46b8becf /backup   ext4    defaults        0       0
```

Disk can be now mounted with

```
osadmin@ST-105:~$ sudo mount /backup
```

Finally check `lsblk`

```
osadmin@ST-105:~$ lsblk
NAME                    MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda                       8:0    0 19.1G  0 disk
|-sda1                    8:1    0  487M  0 part /boot
|-sda2                    8:2    0    1K  0 part
`-sda5                    8:5    0 18.6G  0 part
  |-ipfabric--vg-root   254:0    0 17.6G  0 lvm  /
  `-ipfabric--vg-swap_1 254:1    0  980M  0 lvm  [SWAP]
sdb                       8:16   0   20G  0 disk /backup
sr0                      11:0    1 1024M  0 rom
```

## Deprecated Resize Wizard

IP Fabric appliance < 5.0.0 was using two LVM volumes by default. `ipfabic-vg/root` for system and data, `backup-vg/backup` for `/backup`.
System and data volume was extended over two disks (usually first two). For third and onward, one could choose to extend *root* or *backup* volume.
This was dropped in favour of one system/data disk with possibility to add backup disk. The original script is still present in the system,
but is *discouraged* to use it as it is expecting only `boot` disk to be `sda`, `sdb` as extended `ipfabic-vg/root` and one could choose
how `sd[c-z]` would be used. The new approach with one disk is more versatile, and it is not limited to `sd[a-z]` disks. 

!!! error "Deprecated script"

    This script should not be used anymore. You should run only when you are sure you know what you are doing.

Script location: `/opt/nimpee/sys-lvm-resize.sh`
