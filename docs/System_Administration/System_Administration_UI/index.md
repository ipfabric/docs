# Overview

**System Administration** allows you to:

* check the IP Fabric system status
* do backup/restore of IP Fabric
* update IP Fabric
* create a local administrator account

It is a dedicated web interface that is fully separate from the primary system
functions. It is available on port `8443` (e.g.,
`https://ipfabric.company.com:8443`) and requires the `osadmin` password defined
in the
[First Boot Wizard](../../platform_first_steps/01-deployment.md#complete-first-time-boot-wizard).
