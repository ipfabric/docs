# Overview

The **System Administration** UI allows you to:

* check the IP Fabric system status
* back up or restore your IP Fabric data
* update IP Fabric
* create a local administrator account

It is a dedicated web interface that is fully separate from the primary system
functions. It is available on port `8443` (e.g.,
`https://ipfabric.company.com:8443`) and requires the `osadmin` password defined
in [IPF CLI Config](../../platform_first_steps/02-ipf_cli_config.md).
