!!! danger "IP Fabric Upgrade From Version `6.6.3` (or `6.7.6`)"

    Due to an issue identified within the System Administration UI, upgrading
    IP Fabric from version `6.6.3` (or `6.7.6`) over the internet will fail with
    `Validation failed - Field pathName: "pathName" is required`. The issue has
    been addressed in version `6.7.7` (or newer). If you are running any IP
    Fabric versions from `6.6.3` to `6.7.6`, please upgrade to `6.7.7` or newer
    manually with an update file from <https://releases.ipfabric.io/updates/>.
