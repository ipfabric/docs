!!! info "Upgrade Version Policy"

    We support the following upgrade paths:

    - The **latest** version in the previous major line --> any version in the
      current major line (for example, `6.10.7` --> `7.2.17`).
    - Any version in the current major line --> any newer version in the current
      major line (for example, `7.0.15` --> `7.2.17`).
