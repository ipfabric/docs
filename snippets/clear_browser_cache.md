!!! warning "Clearing Browser Cache"

    To ensure the product works as intended, please force refresh your browser
    cache after each IP Fabric upgrade.
    
    The key combination for doing this depends on your operating system. In your
    browser window with your IP Fabric appliance's URL opened, use one of the
    following key combinations:

    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `F5`
    - macOS: `Command` + `Shift` + `R`
    - Linux: `Ctrl` + `F5`
    
    This will only affect the browser cache for the IP Fabric appliance.
