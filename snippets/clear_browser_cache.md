!!! warning "Clearing Browser Cache"

    After upgrading IP Fabric to a newer version, you should see the `Your
    application has been updated and must be refreshed` dialog in the main GUI.

    It is usually sufficient to just click the **Refresh** button.

    However, in case of issues with the main GUI or if you did not see the
    mentioned dialog, please force refresh your browser cache.

    The key combination for doing this depends on your operating system. In your
    browser window with your IP Fabric appliance's URL open, use one of the
    following key combinations:

    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `F5`
    - macOS: `Command` + `Shift` + `R`
    - Linux: `Ctrl` + `F5`

    This will only affect the browser cache for the IP Fabric appliance.
